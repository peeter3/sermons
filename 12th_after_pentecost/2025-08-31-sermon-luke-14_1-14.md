# THEIR WORKS CRY OUT FOR MERCY
Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, today's Holy Gospel comes to us in two parts: first, our Lord Jesus heals on the Sabbath, and second, our Lord teaches about places of honor or humiliation at a banquet. Though we will consider the place of honor before God, I do not want to neglect the Sabbath, for we do have the Third Commandment, **"Honor the Sabbath day by keeping it holy,"**  and we do want to honor it today and every Sabbath day as God has ordained it.

Today is a good day to note that our Lord Jesus got into a lot of conflict with the lawyers and the Pharisees over the proper observance of the Sabbath—I mean, we do hear about it often in the Gospels and we have it at the beginning of today's Holy Gospel.
> **One Sabbath, when \[Jesus] went to dine at the house of a ruler of the Pharisees, they were watching him carefully. And behold, there was a man before him who had dropsy.**

Dropsy, the swelling of the arms and legs, is also called *edema*. It is caused by the accumulation of watery fluid in the body.
> **And Jesus responded to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?" But they remained silent.**

The answer to our Lord's question is Yes, but why are the lawyers and Pharisees silent? They are silent because they know the Third Commandment that was given to Moses on Mt. Sinai.
> **Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.**  (Ex. 20:8–11)

That was from Exodus, chapter 20. This commandment is repeated again in Deuteronomy, chapter 5:
> **Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the LORD your God commanded you. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant, or your ox or your donkey or any of your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.** ***You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.***  **Therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.**  (Deut. 5:12–15)

Belovèd in the Lord, do you see a difference between these records of the Third Commandment? There's a difference—or I would say there is a *progression*—between the explanation of the Third Commandment from Exodus, chapter 20 to Deuteronomy, chapter 5. In Exodus 20, the LORD refers to resting from Creation, but in Deuteronomy 5, the LORD refers to bringing Israel out of slavery in Egypt. In Deuteronomy 5, God tells His people

Now, going back to the Holy Gospel,
> **Then \[Jesus] took \[the man with dropsy] and healed him and sent him away. And he said to them, "Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?" And they could not reply to these things.**

ZZZ

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

Ps. 131, the psalm for today, is very short.

Another healing on the Sabbath:
Luke 13:10–17
\[10] Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. \[11] And behold, there was a woman who had had a disabling spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not fully straighten herself. \[12] When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, “Woman, you are freed from your disability.” \[13] And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and she glorified God. \[14] But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the people, “There are six days in which work ought to be done. Come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.” \[15] Then the Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it? \[16] And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?” \[17] As he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame, and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him. (ESV)

Last week's Holy Gospel, had we stuck with the three-year lectionary:
Luke 13:22–30
\[22] He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem. \[23] And someone said to him, “Lord, will those who are saved be few?” And he said to them, \[24] “Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. \[25] When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, open to us,’ then he will answer you, ‘I do not know where you come from.’ \[26] Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’ \[27] But he will say, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!’ \[28] In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out. \[29] And people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God. \[30] And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.” (ESV)

1 Peter 2:18–25
\[18] Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust. \[19] For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly. \[20] For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God. \[21] For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps. \[22] He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. \[23] When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. \[24] He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. \[25] For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls. (ESV)

1 Peter 5:6–11
\[6] Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, \[7] casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you. \[8] Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. \[9] Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world. \[10] And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. \[11] To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen. (ESV)

Hebrews 13:5
\[5] Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.” (ESV)

I believe this verse is on the gravestone of F.C.D. Wyneken:
Hebrews 13:7
\[7] Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith. (ESV)

Revelation 21:2–4
\[2] And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. \[3] And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. \[4] He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.” (ESV)

There is godly pride and there is ungodly pride. Perhaps this distinction can be explained under one term: the fear of the Lord.
