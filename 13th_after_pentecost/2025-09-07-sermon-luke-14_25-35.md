# COUNT THE COST OF DISCIPLESHIP

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Bless us, Holy Spirit, to count the cost and gladly follow our Lord Jesus. Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, am I ever glad that AI is here to make our lives better. We have today's Holy Gospel about following our Lord Jesus—about being His disciples—about which our Lord tells us, *\[introduce pun]*  **"Whoever does not** ***bear his own cross*** **and come after Me cannot be my disciple."**  Tell this to AI and it goes *\[bulletin cover]*  like this. Our lives are better already.

That was fun. But now let's set the lightheartedness aside for a little while. As we wind down, let us rejoice that we are assembled as *believers* in Christ. If you are not a believer in Christ, may the Holy Spirit work repentance in your heart that you hear and ever believe that *\[Crucifixion]*  Jesus Christ died on the Cross bearing your sins, and by faith in His name you are forever fully forgiven and you can be sure *\[font]*  that your Baptism washes your sins away and saves you—you're going to heaven. Looking out at the congregation, though, I see that a lot of Christians are here.

"Oh, yes, I'm a believer in Christ."

"Well, then, you are a disciple of Christ."

Satan, with much success, works hard to break this connection between a believer in Jesus and a follower of Jesus. But according Christ's Baptism this must stand: there is *no such thing* as being a believer in Jesus but *not* being a disciple of Jesus. For Christ's command to baptize *\[font]*  goes like this:
> **Go therefore and make** ***disciples*** **of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.**  (Matt. 28:19–20a)

All baptized believers are, by Christ's own Word, disciples, His followers. We are invited by our Lord today to COUNT THE COST OF DISCIPLESHIP—to count the cost of following Him.

Satan works hard to break this connection between believing in Jesus and following Jesus—the devil is the master of distracting us from following our Lord. We have before us this picture from Scripture, and it's not just a picture, it's reality: Jesus is moving forward and speaking to us and either we are following Him or we are not. In order to make this clear, let us consider a parallel passage for today's Holy Gospel, recorded in Mark, chapter 8. This passage may be familiar to you.
> **\[Jesus] began to teach \[His disciples] that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again. And He said this plainly. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. But turning and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter and said, "Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."**  (Mark 8:31–33)

Satan was, as always, working hard to distract Peter from the things of God. Jesus saw His other disciples, who were watching Peter, and knew that they might go astray if Peter went astray, so He rebuked Peter in their hearing: **"Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."**
> **And calling the crowd to Him with His disciples, \[Jesus] said to them, "If anyone would come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and** ***follow Me*."**  (Mark 8:34)

Believing in Christ always comes with our own personal cross—the Lord will choose that for us—believing in Christ always comes with our cross and with this command: **"Follow Me."**  We hear Him say it over and over again.
> **As \[Jesus] passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and He said to him, "Follow Me."**  (Mark 2:14a)
>
> **The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, "Follow Me."**  (John 1:43)
>
> **"Follow Me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead."**  (Matt. 8:22)

(Our Lord says this to a man who wants to bury his own father.) For anyone who has believed in Jesus is also to hear His command: **"Follow Me."**  Now finishing out the parallel passage from Mark, chapter 8, our Lord says this after rebuking St. Peter:
> **"For whoever would save his life will lose it,** ***but whoever loses his life for My sake and the Gospel's will save it*. For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? For what can a man give in return for his soul? For whoever is ashamed of Me and of My Words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels."**  (Mark 8:35–38)

What's at risk in this adulterous and sinful generation is that Satan works hard that we be ashamed of Christ and His Words. We should be proud of Christ and His Words, but Satan works to change our hearts to be ashamed of Christ and His Words. Beware! Once we are ashamed of Christ and His Words, we have stopped following Him. What's at stake is our salvation. Does not our Lord say, **"Whoever is ashamed of Me and of My Words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels"** ?

Belovèd in the Lord, COUNT THE COST OF DISCIPLESHIP—count the cost of following Jesus and not being ashamed of His Word. You may be hated by the world (John 15:18). It may even cost you your family. **"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple."**  *Hate* is a strong word, but we can do no other than let Christ's Word stand and follow Him. I certainly do not hate my father, mother, Trina, Silvi, Aadu, Jaan, and Irene, but I can do no other than let Christ's Word stand and follow Him.

We must hear the whole teaching and pray for the Holy Spirit to guide us. **"If anyone comes to me and does not hate …** ***his own life*, he cannot be my disciple."**  By faith in Jesus, and by the grace of the Spirit, I have come to believe Jesus is the Way—the only way to go is to follow Him. I have come to believe that Jesus is the Truth—His Word is trustworthy and forgiveness in His name cannot be shaken. I have come to believe that Jesus is the Life—without Him death is coming, but with Him life never ends (John 14:6). **The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

## Notes
Luke 13:23–24
\[23] And someone said to him, “Lord, will those who are saved be few?” And he said to them, \[24] “Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. (ESV)

Philemon 10–11
\[10] I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment. \[11] (Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.) (ESV)

*Onesimus* means *useful*.

*Hate* is a strong word.

Here's the art on the bulletin cover. It's a pun on *bearing* our own cross.
