# BY FAITH, TORMENT TURNS TO BLISS

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, we have been blessed this year to have had Hebrews, chapter 11 for our Epistle readings. You've heard these recently, but let us review the heroes of faith.
> **By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, … By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. … By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. … By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. … By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised. … By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau. By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff. By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones. By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict. By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.** (Heb. 11:4–5, 7–8, 11, 20–26)


At this point it is appropriate to introduce Lazarus from today's Holy Gospel. We have before us in today's Holy Gospel the rich man and Lazarus.

Without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who seek Him. (Heb. 11:6)

*The rich man and Lazarus* are biblical household names other than we don't know the rich man's name—we know only that he's in hell.


> **And they shall go out and look on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me. For their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.**  (Is. 66:24)


This is the very last verse of Isaiah.


> **If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell, "where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched."**  (Mark 9:47–48)


Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him? (James 2:5)

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
