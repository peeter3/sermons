# BY FAITH, TORMENT TURNS TO BLISS

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Help us, heavenly Father, to endure whatever trouble is ours in this earthly life to inherit heaven through faith in Your Son, JesAmen.

Belovèd in the Lord, we have been blessed to have heard Hebrews, chapter 11 read earlier this year. Though you've heard this recently, let us hear it again because you know I like it.
> ***By faith*** **Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, …** ***By faith*** **Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. …** ***By faith*** **Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. …** ***By faith*** **Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. …** ***By faith*** **Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered Him faithful who had promised. …** ***By faith*** **Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau.** ***By faith*** **Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff.** ***By faith*** **Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones.** ***By faith*** **Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict. By faith** ***Moses*, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.** ***He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward*.**  (Heb. 11:4–5, 7–8, 11, 20–26)

At this point—that Moses would rather suffer the reproach of Christ than enjoy the treasures of Egypt—that Moses was looking to the reward—at this point it is good to introduce Lazarus—we have Lazarus in our Holy Gospel. We also have before us the rich man with Lazarus. These two, Lazarus and the rich man, are very well known. The reproach of Lazarus is that he is a poor beggar.
> **There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked \[Lazarus's] sores.**

What falls from the rich man's table—what is left over from his sumptuous feasts—is more than enough to feed Lazarus, but Lazarus never gets a scrap. *\[Illustration]*  This brings to mind that as I visit bus stops I cannot help but notice half-eaten chicken laying on the ground. Lazarus would gladly eat these! But the rich man, who watches Lazarus beg at his gate but passes by, gives him nothing. No pity from the rich man—only pity from the dogs that lick Lazarus's sores.

This is the picture of the Lazarus's life, and the rich man's life, in this world. We now take a clue from James, chapter 2, where it is written, **"Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He has promised to those who love Him?"**  (James 2:5) Let us then assume that Lazarus, though he is poor, is rich in faith in Christ Jesus and BY FAITH, HIS TORMENT TURNS TO BLISS.

Having brought up the poor we should not neglect to acknowledge how often we hear in Scripture that God in heaven is particularly concerned with the poor here on earth. We'll stick with the Psalms. It is written in Psalm 12, **" 'Because the poor are plundered, because the needy groan, I will now arise,' says the LORD; 'I will place him in the safety for which he longs.' "**  (Ps. 12:5). And in Psalm 35, **"All my bones shall say, 'O LORD, who is like You, delivering the poor from him who is too strong for him, the poor and needy from him who robs him?' "**  (Ps. 35:10). It is the LORD's signature to take action on behalf of the poor. And in Psalm 41, **"Blessed is the one who considers the poor! In the day of trouble the LORD delivers him"**  (Ps. 41:1). That's a promise, and may the Lord continue to bless our food pantry!

Lazarus's deliverance is that Lazarus dies … and the Lord takes him to heaven.
> **The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried, and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side.**  (Luke 16:22–23)

The rich man is in hell, somehow able to watch Lazarus comforted at Abraham's side. You know Abraham is alive and in heaven—Lazarus is there with him. **"And \[the rich man] called out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.' "**  Hell is called a place of torment in heat, first by the prophet Isaiah:
> **And they shall go out and look on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against Me. For their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.**  (Is. 66:24)

The prophet's words are echoed by our Lord Jesus Himself.
> **If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell, "where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched."**  (Mark 9:47–48)

But, belovèd in the Lord, Jesus is our Savior from hell! Tearing out our eye is repentance with bold letters and an underline. "I hate my sin and I want to stop!" Repent and believe Jesus is our Savior from hell. "I believe in Jesus Christ, who *\[Crucifixion]*  suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. *He descended into hell.*  The third day He rose again from the dead victorious over death and hell." When St. Peter confessed Jesus to be the Christ, the Son of the Living God, what does our Lord answer? **"You are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church,** ***and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it*"**  (Matt. 16:18). Hell is conquered and Jesus had done it! Alleluia!

This must be what Lazarus also believes, for **without faith it is impossible to please Him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who seek Him** (Heb. 11:6). Lazarus believes in Jesus and is saved.

Though *Lazarus and the rich man* are household names, we don't know the rich man's name—we know only that he's in hell. What a shame. Apparently, he never tore out his eye, or whatever part of him that caused him to sin. The rich man never repented of what appears to have been self-interest. "I've got what I want, and that makes me happy." This rich man, whose name we are not told, was never close to bearing the fruit in keeping with repentance (Matt. 3:8).

Now continuing in our Holy Gospel,
> **\[The rich man] said, "Then I beg you, father \[Abraham], to send \[Lazarus] to my father's house—for I have five brothers—so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment." But Abraham said, "They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them."**

Whatever has been recorded in the Bible has been written for our salvation, as we hear Paul write to Timothy,
> **Continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the Scriptures,** ***which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus*. All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.**  (2 Tim. 3:14–17)

If Lazarus had been sent back to the rich man's brothers, it may have been no different than with the other Lazarus, the brother of Martha and Mary, who did come back from the dead.
> **When the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was \[at Bethany], they came, not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well, because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.**  (John 12:9–11)

We with be content with, then, with Moses and the Prophets. We will rejoice in what God has revealed to us in the Bible, that Jesus is the Son of the Living God, and we have life in His name. **The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
