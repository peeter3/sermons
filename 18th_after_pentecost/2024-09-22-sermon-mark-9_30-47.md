# HE MUST BE LAST OF ALL AND SERVANT OF ALL

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, there is a thing or two in life that our Lord Jesus turns on its head, for example, forgiving our enemies (Matt. 5:44). Hasn't He ever heard about *payback*? He turns it on its head, like every man **who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart** (Matt. 5:28). Hasn't He ever heard about *check her out*? Hasn't He ever heard of *girlie magazines*? He also turns it on its head when, in our Holy Gospel, He says, **"If anyone would be** ***first*, HE MUST BE LAST OF ALL AND SERVANT OF ALL."**

*\[Illustration]*  Back in the days when we ran our Can‑Do daycare, our fine teachers taught our preschoolers some important life skills, like getting in line. You can pretty well guess that "Who's first in line?" was an issue that our teachers had to deal with. Where do children ever get the idea *to care* about who's first in line anyway? … Doesn't the Bible say we're born sinful? And if the teacher ever said, "Go to the back of the line!" it was never to reward a child.

HE MUST BE LAST OF ALL AND SERVANT OF ALL, JUST LIKE JESUS. **For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many** (Mark 10:45).

Jesus could have come as Creator, just to share His Creation with us, like a heavenly science teacher.
> **\[Jesus] awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.**  (Mark 4:39)

He could have come as our heavenly science teacher, but He chose to come instead, as our Servant.

Christ is at the back of the line, making sure the rest of the line gets to where it's supposed to. Christ, our servant, is our Good Shepherd.

Who's first in line? Is sure ain't Jesus.

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep \[our] hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

## Notes
Isaiah 42:1–4
\[1] Behold my servant, whom I uphold,
my chosen, in whom my soul delights;
I have put my Spirit upon him;
he will bring forth justice to the nations.
\[2] He will not cry aloud or lift up his voice,
or make it heard in the street;
\[3] a bruised reed he will not break,
and a faintly burning wick he will not quench;
he will faithfully bring forth justice.
\[4] He will not grow faint or be discouraged
till he has established justice in the earth;
and the coastlands wait for his law. (ESV)

Christ is called God's servant by the prophet Isaiah.

Jeremiah 10:5
\[5] Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field,
and they cannot speak;
they have to be carried,
for they cannot walk.
Do not be afraid of them,
for they cannot do evil,
neither is it in them to do good.” (ESV)
