# REMEMBERING THE OTHER SAMARITAN

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, let's remember our favorite Samaritans. Samaritan, Samaritan, who can name for me a Samaritan? There's
* the Good Samaritan, of course, of Luke, chapter 10,
* the Samaritan woman of John, chapter 4, and
* the Samaritan who returns to give thanks in today's Holy Gospel.

(This Samaritan, by the way, always appears at the Thanksgiving Eve service.) *\[Ask]*  Have I forgotten any Samaritans? And I dare say that of all of these, the Good Samaritan is the most famous. The Good Samaritan is—well, the Good Samaritan is good. The Samaritan woman at the well—you'd have to say she's good. Our Samaritan leper who is healed and returns to give thanks—he's also recognized as good. We'll call him *the other Samaritan*—one Samaritan among many good Samaritans. Today we are REMEMBERING THE OTHER SAMARITAN.

We've named some Samaritans from the Bible. *\[Ask]*  So, are Samaritans good or are they bad? … They're *bad*—really, really bad. The Samaritans have a long history of being bad, and if you're familiar with the Old Testament, it is not hard to understand *why* the Samaritans are bad. The Samaritans are bad because Jeroboam was a bad king. The Samaritans are bad because Ahab also was a bad king, and how can we forget how evil his wife Jezebel was? These Samaritans are bad because the Assyrians were bad. It is not hard to tell from the Bible how bad the Samaritans were.

Let's start with the connection between the Assyrians and the Samaritans. The Assyrians were bad—back in the day—back in their heyday in Old Testament times the Assyrians were the nation to be feared. They were the ones who conquered other nations before the Babylonians came and gobbled them up. The Assyrians, in their days of power, would come to a city, offer kind treatment if the city gave up, but chop off their heads if they did not. (There's a fine museum in Chicago, by the way, the Oriental Institute, with Assyrian artifacts.) The capital of Assyria, Nineveh, was well known. It is to this very city that the Lord sent Jonah to preach (Jonah 1:2).

722 B.C. was a big year. Back in 722 B.C., the Assyrians attacked the kingdom of Israel and conquered it—they conquered Israel and its capital, Samaria. *Samaria* is where the name *Samaritans* comes from. Remember that at that time the tribes of Israel were no longer one nation, but two:
* the northern kingdom of Israel with its capital, Samaria;
* the southern kingdom of Judah with it capital, Jerusalem, the holy city.


When the Assyrians conquered the northern kingdom, they conquered the ten tribes of Israel that lived up north: the tribes of Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Ephraim, and Manasseh. The conquerors left some of the Israelites there and sent the others to the far corners of the Assyrian empire; that's called *deportation*. The Assyrians replaced the people they had deported with some of their own native people—this is an effective way to conquer a nation and keep it under your control.

That left what had been the territory of kingdom of Israel half populated with Jews and half populated with Assyrians. These people mixed—they intermarried and they worshiped one another's gods. But is this a good thing? No—this is a big no-no with the Lord because he cannot tolerate his people worshiping any god but Him alone (Deut. 7:3–4). For it is written, **"I am the LORD; that is My name; My glory I give to no other, nor My praise to carved idols"**  (Is. 42:8). This mixture of Assyrians and Jews came to be called *the Samaritans*, and they were bad because they worshiped idols—they mixed the worship of idols with the worship of the one true God of Israel.

But this was nothing new for the Samaritans—not for their Jewish side. For these ten tribes of Israel had previously been ruled by Ahab, whose wife was Jezebel. Baal—the Israelites had fallen for Baal long ago (1 Kings 16:31–33). Need I say more? And even before that they had worshiped the golden calves at Dan and Bethel—the Bible calls this *the sin of Jeroboam* (1 Kings 12:28–29). Need I say more? If you're familiar with the Old Testament, I do not need to say any more. These are the Samaritans, and they were bad idolaters—no wonder the Jews in the days of Jesus had no dealings with the Samaritans (John 4:9).

All this to say that it is one big surprise to hear Samaritans spoken of kindly in the New Testament. The Good Samaritan who showed mercy to the man who had been robbed, beaten, and left for dead (Luke 10:30) forever enshrines *Good* with *Samaritan*. The Samaritan woman at the well believed in Jesus, and went and told her friends and they believed in Him, too (John 4:39). What we have in the New Testament are Samaritans believing in the Jewish Messiah and doing good and showing mercy. For the Lord says, **"I desire mercy, not sacrifice"**  (Hos. 6:6; Matt. 9:13). The Samaritans have found mercy, but the Jews are stuck on sacrifice.

*\[Transition]*  And when it comes to sacrifice, belovèd in the Lord, we always have *\[Crucifixion]*  the Cross. As St. Paul declares, **"I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified"**  (1 Cor. 2:2). *\[Chancel]*  Having confessed our sin before God, we rejoice in the preaching of the Cross that declares that Christ's sacrifice has taken away the sin we have confessed—even the sin we are not aware of—yes, even the sin of the world (John 1:29). His once-for-all sacrifice—the shedding of His holy, precious blood on the Cross—is the fulfillment of the Old Testament animals sacrifices so that we hear in Hebrews, chapter 10, **"We have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all"**  (Heb. 10:10). who was sacrificed on the Cross, bearing our sins—showing mercy to us sinners. We should never talk *sacrifice* without acknowledging

One of them is the Samaritan leper in our Holy Gospel.
> **\[Jesus] was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance and lifted up their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us." When He saw them He said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." And as they went they were cleansed. Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; and he fell on his face at Jesus’ feet, giving Him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan.**  (ESV)

The Jews who had been healed did not return to give thanks to Jesus, but the Samaritan did.

Now this, I could say, is a fulfillment of Scripture.

when we in church say sacrifice, I would hope that your first thought is to go *\[Crucifixion]*  to the Cross—where the Son of God was sacrificed in our place to win the forgiveness of our sins. But *sacrifice* is a loaded word in the Bible—there are all kinds of sacrifices, for example, the Old Testament animal sacrifices.

There's the Good Samaritan of Luke, chapter 10.

And, of course, there's the Samaritan woman of John, chapter 4.

But today we have

Samaritans came from Jeroboam, Ahab and Jezebel, mixed in with Assyrians. The Jews looked down on them for good reason. Not so much a Steelers fan but one who practices voodoo—or a Moabite, like Ruth.

Why did God not destroy the Samaritans altogether?

In the Bible, and with the leper who returned to give thanks, with the neighbors of the Samaritan woman at Sychar, it's like the Samaritans are beating down the door to enter the kingdom of heaven.

We believe in Jesus, and we're never going back to our idols. But we will go back to Him and thank Him.

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

\[15] And she said, “See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.” \[16] But Ruth said, “Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God. \[17] Where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the LORD do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you.” (ESV)

Matthew 10:5–7
\[5] These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, “Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, \[6] but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. \[7] And proclaim as you go, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ (ESV)

Matthew 10:8

Psalm 50:7–15
\[7] “Hear, O my people, and I will speak;
O Israel, I will testify against you.
I am God, your God.

your burnt offerings are continually before me.
\[9] I will not accept a bull from your house
or goats from your folds.
\[10] For every beast of the forest is mine,
the cattle on a thousand hills.
\[11] I know all the birds of the hills,
and all that moves in the field is mine.


\[12] “If I were hungry, I would not tell you,
for the world and its fullness are mine.
\[13] Do I eat the flesh of bulls
or drink the blood of goats?
\[14] Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving,
and perform your vows to the Most High,
\[15] and call upon me in the day of trouble;
I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.” (ESV)

\[15] Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name. (ESV)
