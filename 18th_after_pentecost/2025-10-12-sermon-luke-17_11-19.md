# REMEMBERING THE OTHER SAMARITAN

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, when we in church say sacrifice, I would hope that your first thought is to go *\[Crucifixion]*  to the Cross—where the Son of God was sacrificed in our place to win the forgiveness of our sins. But *sacrifice* is a loaded word in the Bible—there are all kinds of sacrifices, for example, the Old Testament animal sacrifices.

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

## Notes
Ruth 1:15–17
\[15] And she said, “See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.” \[16] But Ruth said, “Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God. \[17] Where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the LORD do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you.” (ESV)

2 Timothy 2:13
\[13] if we are faithless, he remains faithful—for he cannot deny himself. (ESV)

Sacrifice of praise/thanksgiving.

Psalm 50:7–15
\[7] “Hear, O my people, and I will speak;
O Israel, I will testify against you.
I am God, your God.
\[8] Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you;
your burnt offerings are continually before me.
\[9] I will not accept a bull from your house
or goats from your folds.
\[10] For every beast of the forest is mine,
the cattle on a thousand hills.
\[11] I know all the birds of the hills,
and all that moves in the field is mine.


\[12] “If I were hungry, I would not tell you,
for the world and its fullness are mine.
\[13] Do I eat the flesh of bulls
or drink the blood of goats?
\[14] Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving,
and perform your vows to the Most High,
\[15] and call upon me in the day of trouble;
I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.” (ESV)

Job 1:21
\[21] And he said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.” (ESV)

Hebrews 13:15
\[15] Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name. (ESV)
