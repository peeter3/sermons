# BEHOLD, THIS CHILD IS APPOINTED FOR THE FALL AND RISING OF MANY

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, according to today's Holy Gospel, you might think that today, in the church calendar, must be the commemoration of Simeon, the man who comes in the Spirit into the temple to proclaim the baby Jesus as the light of both Jew and Gentile—the Christ, who is at this time but an infant, only six weeks old (Lev. 12:3–4). **"\[Simeon] took \[Jesus] up in his arms and blessed God and said,** *\[sing]*  **'Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace according to Thy Word, for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast preparèd before the face of all people, …' "**  Yes, you have sung this Song of Simeon, the Nunc Dimittis, hundreds—could it be thousands?—of times after receiving the Sacrament, *\[altar]*  the holy body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which we with our own lips receive for our salvation. These very words are given to us by the Spirit through the mouth of Simeon when he holds the infant Jesus in his arms and blesses God.

The Song of Simeon is constantly on our lips. And as the church calendar, found in the hymnal, lists famous Christians to commemorate, we would expect Simeon is on this list. After all, didn't he give us the Nunc Dimittis, which we sing all the time? But, surprisingly, Simeon is not on the list. *Simon* the apostle is on the list, but Simeon is not listed for commemoration on the church calendar, believe it or not. So be it. (If you don't like it, get on the hymnal committee.)

Nevertheless, the Spirit has a few things to tell us through Simeon this day, so we do well to pay attention. The first is his song of joy at holding the infant Savior of the world in his arms—*\[sing]*  **"a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of Thy people I-srael."**  Alleluia!

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

## Notes
[Feast or Festival?](https://witness.lcms.org/2011/feast-or-festival-10-2011/) A feast is technically a one-day celebration; a festival is a multi-day celebration. So, a festival is a bigger deal than a feast. The bold-font entries on LSB xi are then festivals and the regular-font entries are feasts. Commemorations are even less important, and are found listed on LSB xii–xiii.

Exodus 13:14–16
\[14] And when in time to come your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ you shall say to him, ‘By a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery. \[15] For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of animals. Therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all the males that first open the womb, but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’ \[16] It shall be as a mark on your hand or frontlets between your eyes, for by a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.” (ESV)

Ps. 111 is the Psalm of the week.

Luke 2:21 is the Holy Gospel for the Circumcision and Name of Jesus (New Year's Day).

Luke 2:21
\[21] And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. (ESV)

The Holy Gospel is the Purification of Mary and the Presentation of the Lord.
