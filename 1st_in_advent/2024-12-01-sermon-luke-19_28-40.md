# WE WISH TO SERVE THE RIGHTEOUS BRANCH OF DAVID

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, we have started the new church year: the season of Advent—the four Sundays before Christmas. What are we so excited about? We do this every year. We ponder now, as we do every year, that the promised Messiah was long-awaited for thousands of years before He was ever born. And now, after His birth, death, and Resurrection, it's still exciting to consider *that He ever came* as God had promised us. His coming the first time will ever raise our hopes although He has already come. So we light a candle and turn our eyes to heaven, from where our help comes. **"Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth"**  (Ps. 124:8).

We put ourselves in the shoes, today, of the Old Testament believers who shuddered at the idolatry going on all around them in faithless Judah, six hundred years before Christ. The LORD raised up the prophet Jeremiah to rebuke idolatry and then to proclaim the Messiah that is to come.

Manasseh was an awful king: he burned his son as an offering. He also consulted with fortune-tellers, mediums, and necromancers, those who speak with the spirits of the dead. **He did much evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger** (2 Ki. 21:6).

Manasseh's grandson Josiah, however, was a righteous king. *\[Ask]*  Do you remember what King Josiah did? During the reign of Josiah, Hilkiah the high priest found the scroll of the Law of Moses, of all things, in the temple! Hilkiah have it to Shaphan, Josiah's secretary, and Shaphan read it to the king (2 Ki. 22:8–10). Josiah was a wonderful king compared to Manasseh, for when he heard God's Law, he repented for himself and for the nation which he led and led Judah in repentance of idolatry and in hearing and doing God's Law. A noteworthy act of Josiah is that **he defiled Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, that no one might burn his son or his daughter as an offering to Molech** (2 Kings 23:10), the idol of the Ammonites.

Josiah was a wonderful king, but the LORD's Word concerning Judah is nevertheless foreboding:
> **Before \[Josiah] there was no king like him, who turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moses, nor did any like him arise after him.**
> **Still the LORD did not turn from the burning of his great wrath, by which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations with which** ***Manasseh*** **had provoked him.**

The idolatry of Manassah was so bad that even Josiah's reforms did not *propitiate* God's anger.
> **And the LORD said, "I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city that I have chosen, Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there."**  (2 Ki. 23:25–27)

Josiah was what we would want any king to be. And though he was great, he was *not great enough*. Judah needs a King who can do *better than the king who did everything right*. And to proclaim this Messianic King God raised up the prophet Jeremiah, who prophesied during and after the reign of Josiah. Jeremiah proclaimed,
> **Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is the name by which he will be called: "The LORD is our righteousness."**  (Jer. 23:5–6)


Jeremiah 23:5–6
\[5] “Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. \[6] In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is the name by which he will be called: ‘The LORD is our righteousness.’ (ESV)

Jeremiah 33:15
\[15] In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David, and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. (ESV)

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep \[our] hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
