# HE COMES TO BRING PEACE TO JERUSALEM

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, Happy New Year, and the themes for the four Sundays of Advent are Hope, Peace, Joy, and Love, in that order, with the pink candle lit for Joy. However, the psalm for today fits the theme of Peace beautifully as we have heard: **"Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. … Peace be within your walls."**  And — what do you know — but next week the theme of Hope comes up powerfully. So I will preach on the theme of Peace today and the theme of Hope next week — switching the themes for the First and Second Sundays of Advent. The lectionary is not perfect, but God's Word most certainly is.

Psalms these days are remembered by number, but they were not always numbered. Instead, they have, for a very long time, been remembered by the first line. The best-known example may be when our Lord was *\[Crucifixion]*  hanging on the Cross bearing our sins He cried out, **"My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"**  (Matt. 27:46) Everyone familiar with the Psalter would have known He was calling out the psalm, which we refer to as Psalm 22. And so, we have today the psalm **"I was glad when they said to me, 'Let us go to the house of the LORD!' "**  The very next verse is **"Our feet have been standing within your gates,** ***O Jerusalem*!"**  *\[Understatement]*  And, in case this was news to you, Jerusalem is an important city.

In fact, I would say that it is no exaggeration to say that Jerusalem, to this day is not only still an important city, but may be the most important city in the world today, and it's all spelled out in the Bible. I will avoid political and military discussion about what's going on right now in and around Jerusalem, but suffice it to say that there are a lot of guns pointed at Jerusalem and there are a lot of guns pointing out from Jerusalem. It is striking that our psalm is a prayer for *the peace* of Jerusalem. Let hear, then, how OUR LORD JESUS COMES TO BRING PEACE TO JERUSALEM.

As the psalm begins, we are joyfully on our way to *the house of the LORD*, which refers to *the temple* in Jerusalem. In Old Testament days this was understood by the Jewish people, of course, as a joyous psalm to sing on the way to make sacrifices and prayers at the temple in the holy city Jerusalem — the city made holy by God's own presence in the cloud over the ark of the covenant, which was in the temple. The temple is the big deal in Jerusalem, but what makes the temple a big deal is God having chosen to be there, in the cloud. In fact, there's a psalm for that — here's the first verse — I won't tell you the number.
> **The LORD reigns; let the peoples tremble! He sits enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake.**  (Ps. 99:1)

The cherubim are a reference to the Mercy Seat, the cover on the ark of the covenant. God is in the cloud over the Mercy Seat, **enthroned upon the cherubim**, and the psalm says.

But the prophet Malachi has announced something new to happen at the temple. He declares in the first verse of the third chapter, **"The Lord whom you seek will suddenly** ***come to His temple*; and the Messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, He is coming, says the LORD of hosts"**  (Mal. 3:1b). (For those of you familiar with Handel's *Messiah*, you may recall that this verse is sung in the *Messiah*.) Malachi prophesied that the Lord would come to His temple. "He is already there, in the cloud," you could hear someone say. But this appears to be a new appearing of the Lord to His temple. Furthermore, He is called ***the Messenger of the covenant in whom you delight***.



**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
