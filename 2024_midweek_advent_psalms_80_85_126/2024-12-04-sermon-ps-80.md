# RESTORE US, O LORD

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, there comes a time, when things have gotten bad enough, that we would really appreciate if things would be better again. There may be perhaps no better example than Adam and Eve. Speaking of things getting better … At first things were perfect.

Genesis 2:7
\[7] then the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature. (ESV)

When things went bad God turned His face from Adam and Eve. They sure turned their face from Him.

The Lord has fed us with the bread of tears (5a), but our hopes are up that things will get better.

HOPE

O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry with your people's prayers? (4)

Genesis 3:15
\[15] I will put enmity between you and the woman,
and between your seed and her seed;
he shall bruise your head,
and you shall bruise his heel.” (ESV)

We put our hope in the Seed of the Woman.

Psalm 80:17
\[17] But let your hand be on the man of your right hand,
the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself! (ESV)

We put our hope in the Son of Man.

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep \[our] hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
