# HOW DOES THE BIBLE INTRODUCE MARY?

Belovèd in the Lord, this year's sermon series is *All About Mary*. But you may be disappointed to know that the sermon series is *not* really only about Mary, but rather it is truly *All About Jesus* through what we are told about Mary, the God-bearer, the *theotokos*, His human mother.

I introduced Mary as *theotokos*, which is a term out of church history. But HOW DOES THE BIBLE INTRODUCE MARY? We hear about her the most in Luke, chapter 1. The first think we hear is that the angel Gabriel has been sent from God to speak to Mary: **"In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth."**  The Greek word *angel* means *messenger*. Gabriel is a messenger sent by God. To where is Gabriel sent? To Nazareth.

The Bible teaches us that angels are heavenly creatures. Just as there are creatures on earth there are creatures in heaven, which we don't normally see. But if we do see them, something special is going on. Gabriel has been sent from heaven to earth to speak with a virgin betrothed to be married, Mary. This marks Mary as a special person. But that may be an understatement, for, after all, we will be considering her for a whole sermon series. But Mary is special, indeed.



**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
