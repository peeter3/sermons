# RETURN TO DUST

Belovèd in the Lord, our theme for this year's Lenten midweek sermons is *Three Days of Holy Week*. That is, Holy Week begins with Palm Sunday. Then come the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of Holy Week. On these three days we will have no services. The next time we do have a service during Holy Week is on Maundy *Thursday*, then Good Friday, of course. We will not have a service on Holy Saturday, but then is Easter Sunday, the celebration of our Lord's Resurrection. Between Palm Sunday and Maundy Thursday, then, there are three days: the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of Holy Week, which we are wont to skip over. We will not skip over them this year! These Three Days of Holy Week—Holy Monday, Holy Tuesday, and Holy Wednesday, call them holy for Holy Week—will be our midweek Lenten theme.

We will start with the Monday of Holy Week next week. But today, we begin with Adam's fall into sin in the Garden of Eden. Without the Fall, we would have no Lent, we would have nothing to repent of, and we would need no Savior from the devil.

We have for our reading tonight the curses that the LORD spoke upon Satan, upon Eve, then upon Adam. Let us hear them again. **"The LORD God said to the serpent, 'Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.' "**  And till this day we have slithering snakes. How they moved before, I do not know.

**"I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel."**  *Enmity* means *enemies*. There is much too much enmity in the world today—too many enemies, too many fights, too much war. But this verse is not a prophecy of the wars to come but it is the prophecy of a battle to be won for us against the devil by our Savior Jesus.
> **To the woman He said, "I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you."**

And by the husband ruling over his wife, since this is listed among the Lord's curses, I believe it means all the abuse that dominating husbands have ever inflicted on their wives. None of it would have ever happened had Adam listened to God's Word.
> **And to Adam he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life.**

The words that Eve spoke to Adam when she gave him the forbidden fruit and he ate it are not recorded. But what horrid words they were, no matter how nicely they may have been spoken. Adam should have ignored her and clung solely to what God had said: **"You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die"**  (Gen. 2:16b–17). Because Adam listened to Eve and ignored the LORD, the ground that we weed today—the ground from which grow the thistles that prick us—the ground is cursed and does not readily yield food for us as it did before the Fall.
> **Thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken;** ***for you are dust, and to dust you shall return*.**

God declares the curse of death rather gently as a returning to the ground. But all of us, who are living and breathing here today, whose smiling faces and voices mean the world to me and those who know you. The precious memories we have of our loved ones and those who have touched our lives in wonderful ways have all come from living, breathing people and had Adam only listened to God and not to his wife—for this is a curse spoken directly to Adam—had Adam only listened to God we would never lose them—we would always have them alive and with us! But they, and you and I, know only this verdict: RETURN TO DUST. There comes a time when no longer are we there for someone, and no longer is that someone there for us. And our sadness is so very deep.




**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
