# GOD WANTS BABY TALK
(This is a re-preaching of a sermon I preached on October 4, 2009.)

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, *\[ask]*  have you ever raised a teenager? … Have you ever raised a baby? … What's the difference?
* For one you have to change his or her diaper but other does his business on his own.
* One smells sweeter than the other—other than that diaper change, that is.
* One is easier to wrestle than the other.

Another difference between a baby and a teenager—and the one on which we will focus today—is talk: the conversation you have with a baby is different than the conversation you have with a teenager.

Baby talk is definitely different from teenager talk. First of all, we parents feed the baby—we feed her with food, yes, but we also feed her with *words*. "Mama loves you, dumpling. What's in your diaper? Look, it's Daddy." And so baby's vocabulary grows, mostly supplied by her parents and older siblings. It *is* remarkable that your child learned practically all of his or her words from you. Teenagers, on the other hand, have many more sources of vocabulary, and, God forbid, these days their phones can be particularly harmful sources of vocabulary. *\[Anecdote]*  You know, even before cell phones, even before I was a teenager, I was able to learn some vocabulary in the neighborhood that earned me … a taste … of soap.

Another difference between talking with a baby and talking with a teenager is that one trusts you more and the other challenges you more. Challenging is not all that bad, though. But you can sure tell the difference between talking to a baby and talking to a teenager. Don't get me wrong: talking to a teenager is wonderful—I would even say it's an honor—in that we are participating in the formation of an adult—the teenager, by talking to you, is learning to speak as an adult.

*\[Transition]*  Now in the Gospel of Mark our Lord warns us about a particular kind of talk that is harmful—so dangerous that He warns us, **"Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod"**  (Mark 8:15b). The Gospel of Luke records a warning with a bit more detail: **"Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is** ***hypocrisy*"**  (Luke 12:1b). This kind of speech, hypocrisy, is dangerous to our souls. Our Lord goes on to say,
> **Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed on the housetops.**  (Luke 12:2–3)

Now let us note the difference between the talk of a teenager and the talk of *a Pharisee*. When a teenager talks, hypocrisy, because of the flesh, has begun to creep in. But with a Pharisee, hypocrisy is full-blown.


**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep \[our] hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
