# TREASURE JESUS, LACK NOTHING

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, you may have been to the nail parlor and let yourself be pampered. Maybe you've been to the spa for some hot massage stone therapy. You came home relaxed—stress is gone—and thought, "You know, I might just do that again." Pleasure—you know, if it feels good I just might want to do that again.

In case you don't use this word often, let me ask you: *\[ask]*  who is a hedonist? A hedonist is a person devoted to the pursuit of pleasure. "If it feels good I'm going to do it. If it tastes good I'm going to eat it. If there's pleasure out there, I'm going to experience it and live." And that is probably the thing about pleasure: when something pleases us we feel *alive*, *\[illustration]*  like … chocolate whipped cream … on a fluffy pancake. (Now don't run out of church and straight to your kitchen.)

When it comes to pleasure, chocolate whipping cream serves as a fine example. *\[Ask]*  What might we reasonably expect after years of enjoying chocolate whipping cream? A trip to the cardiologist and, God forbid, premature *death* from heart failure. Please, if you will, connect the unfortunate circumstance of a little too much chocolate whipping cream with the well-known verse written by Paul in Romans, chapter 6: **"The wages of sin is death"**  (Rom. 6:23a). There is pleasure that leads to death. The pattern worked out by the devil is all too well-known to us all: it makes you feel alive and then it kills you.

*\[Transition]*  But there is also pleasure that leads to life.

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep \[our] hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
