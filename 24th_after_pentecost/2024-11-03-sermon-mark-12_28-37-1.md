# DAVID CALLS HIM "LORD." HOW IS HE HIS SON?

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, *\[sing]*
> *For all the saints who from their labors rest,* 
> *Who Thee by faith before the world confessed*

Today's the day to sing it, but so is every other day. Esther has already instructed me to sing it to her at her deathbed. All the saints, both Old Testament and New, confess Jesus Christ to be Lord and God.

We have, of course, St. Peter's confession of faith in the New Testament: **"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God"**  (Matt. 16:16). But in the Old Testament we have Job's confession of faith, which was heard at both Sandy's and Winnie's gravesides this week:
> **Oh, that my words were written! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book! That they were engraved on a rock With an iron pen and lead, forever! For I know that my Redeemer lives, And He shall stand at last on the earth. And after my skin is destroyed, this I know, that in my flesh I shall see God, whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!**  (Job 19:23–27)

And in today's Holy Gospel we are directed to another Old Testament confession of faith in Jesus, the first verse of Psalm 110: **"The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet'"**  Our Lord Jesus brings this up with the scribes, who as you know are well-trained in the Scriptures—very well trained.

Nikki, Tommy, and Julie heard

Genesis 3:15
\[15] I will put enmity between you and the woman,
and between your seed and her seed;
he shall bruise your head,
and you shall bruise his heel.” (ESV)

John 20:28
\[28] Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!” (ESV)

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep \[our] hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
