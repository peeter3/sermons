# SITTING AT THE FEET OF JESUS, CLOTHED AND IN HIS RIGHT MIND

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, today's Holy Gospel is perhaps *the* most famous account of our Lord Jesus Christ casting out demons—this account is found not only in Luke, but also in Matthew and Mark. Our Lord casts the legion of demons out of a man and into a herd of pigs, which then run down the steep bank and drown themselves in the Sea of Galilee.

Imagine we were in a fishing boat that day, fishing off the southeast coast of the Sea of Galilee, in the land of the Gerasenes. We hear the massive roar of *two thousand* squealing pigs (Mark 5:13) and see the cloud of dust coming down the embankment—two thousand pigs throwing themselves into the sea and drowning—two thousand dead pigs floating in the water. What is going on?

What is going on is that there were two men (Matt. 8:28)—Luke's account mentions only one of them—two men possessed by not one, not two, but by a whole *legion* of demons. That's the bad news. The good news is that Jesus Christ has commanded the demons to leave the men. The good news recorded by Luke is that the one is now SITTING AT THE FEET OF JESUS, CLOTHED AND IN HIS RIGHT MIND, thanks be to God!

How did these men get possessed by demons? We are not told, but we do have the biblical example of Judas Iscariot—a lesson we remember from Holy Week.
**"\[Judas] used to help himself to what was put into \[the moneybag]"**  (John 12:6).

> **When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, but finds none. Then it says, "I will return to my house from which I came." And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order. Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So also will it be with this evil generation.**  (Matt. 12:43–45)




**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
