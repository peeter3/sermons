# THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST STILL COMES

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, my sister and mother are visiting the old country this week. And thanks be to God for Silvi, because none of this would happen without her. But fifty-five years ago, it was unimaginable to hop on a flight and fly to Estonia to visit the relatives because Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union.

Nevertheless, fifty-five years ago, relatives in Estonia could apply to travel out of the country to visit their kinfolk. And I remember the excitement that my great aunt, Alma, was coming to Canada to visit my grandparents, for Alma Tädi and my grandmother were sisters. My family traveled up from Chicago, where we lived, to Canada to be there, of course, when my great aunt arrived.

This was perhaps my first experience of intense anticipation. Anticipating my birthday was one thing, but this was something else. I had relatives—people who I could talk to who knew who I was—people who knew about me but the situation in the world did not allow us to see each other. I was aware that getting to see Alma Tädi was far more precious than any toy I might get for my birthday. So I really wanted to see her and talk to her.

But she didn't come. There were complications in Moscow. We climbed back in the car and took the snowy Highway 401 back toward Chicago. … And then she finally came. My dad must have called back to check. She was coming after all! We turned around and when we arrived back at my grandparents', there she was! Alma Tädi! I had heard her name a thousand times and now I saw her and spoke with her. I cannot forget that day.



**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

## Notes
God's clear Word about tithing comes after the end of the Old Testament lesson.

Malachi 3:7–10
\[7] From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts. But you say, ‘How shall we return?’ \[8] Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In your tithes and contributions. \[9] You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you. \[10] Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby put me to the test, says the LORD of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need. (ESV)
