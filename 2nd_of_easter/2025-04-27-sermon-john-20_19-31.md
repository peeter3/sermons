# JUST AS HE IS RISEN FROM THE DEAD, THIS IS MOST CERTAINLY TRUE.

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, when our Lord appeared to His disciples after His Resurrection, they were hiding behind closed doors for fear of the Jews. However, Scripture is clear that they were not ignorant of Christ foretelling His Resurrection. Christ speaks in John, chapter 2,
> **"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." The Jews then said, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?" But He was speaking about the temple of His body. When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples** ***remembered*** **that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the Word that Jesus had spoken.**  (John 2:19b–22)

They were not ignorant—they had just forgotten as they were hiding behind closed doors.

It happened to them and it can happen to us. **"When \[the Good Shepherd] has brought out all his own, He goes before them, and the sheep follow Him, for they know His voice"**  (John 10:4), but if we do not remember what He has said, whose voice do we follow? **"A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers"**  (John 10:5). May the Spirit grant us wisdom to flee from Satan's lies, but it we still do not remember Christ's Word, we are, at best, in a precarious situation.

Perhaps the most important Word to remember is Christ's traditional First Word from the Cross: **"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do"**  (Luke 23:34a). That is, of all the doubts that assail us, the most dangerous and the most satanic is the doubt that our sins have truly been removed from us as far as the east is from the west (Ps. 103:12) by Christ's blood, given and shed for us for the forgiveness of our sins. He even proclaims it from the Cross, for crying out loud: **"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do"** ! Remember that Word from the Cross and remember Isaiah's prophecy: **"Upon Him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed"**  (Is. 53:5b).

This peace we hear Christ declare over and over again to the disciples who had been hiding:


"Peace be with you. … Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you." And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld." … (ESV) (John 20:19b, 21–23)

And then one more time, eight days later, to doubting Thomas: **"Peace be with you"**  (John 20:26b). Christ never tires of saying, **"Peace be with you."**  Belovèd in the Lord, what kind of peace it this? Isaiah's prophecy declares it plainly: it is the peace worked by Christ bearing our sins—it is the peace that comes when sin is punished and justice is served—it is the peace with God won for us by the Son of God, who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29).

Christ may have told us something but we just plain forgot. Well, forgetting Christ's Word is the same as not knowing it at all, and in the case of the disciples

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
