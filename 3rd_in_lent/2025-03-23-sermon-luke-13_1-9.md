# THE LORD IS PATIENT, THAT ALL SHOULD REACH REPENTANCE.

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, the color for Lent is purple, and someone on the church calendar committee came up with purple standing for repentance. Purple is the color of repentance and it has been chosen to be the liturgical color for Lent. It's my favorite color, and it also may be God's favorite color, for **there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance** (Luke 15:7). Our Lord tells us that all of heaven is very, very happy over our repentance.

Repentance is a word that we often hear and often think about. First, the Greek Word for *repentance* in the New Testament simply means *change your mind*. "Did you change your mind about your sin?"

"Yes, I sure did. I was wrong and I don't want to"—for the sake of example—"I don't want to gossip anymore." For we have the Eighth Commandment:
> **You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.**  *What does this mean?*  We should fear and love God so that we do not tell lies about our neighbor, betray him, slander him, or hurt his reputation, but defend him, speak well of him, and explain everything in the kindest way.

"I was wrong, and I won't gossip anymore" triggers that joy in heaven, and that's what repentance is: changing our mind about sin. What a precious thing it is that one sinner's repentance would trigger an automatic celebration in heaven.

*\[Illustration]*  Here on earth, the birth of a child automatically triggers a celebration for parents who want the child. It's a deep and profound joy—it certainly was for Trina and me, and I thank God for that joy and this joy endures to this day—I'd even say it grows. Well, it may be reasonable to say that the joy in heaven over one sinner who repents is similar to parents who rejoice over the birth of their child.

In fact, the Bible does have the expression *born from above*. Are you familiar with it? **"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born** ***from above*** **he cannot see the kingdom of God"**  (John 3:3b). "No, no," you say. "That's not right. It's **born** ***again***. Since I've brought out the Greek I might as well bring it out one more time. The Greek word for *again* can also mean *from above*—it's just how Greek works. So, we have, still in John, chapter 3,
> **Do not marvel that I said to you, "You must be** ***born from above*." The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is** ***born of the Spirit*.**  (John 3:7–8)

Our Lord Jesus speaks of *born of the Spirit* and *born from above* in the same breath. And to be *born from above* means to be born in heaven, so there actually has been a birth in heaven. One sinner who repents has literally been born in heaven and the angels rejoice!

*\[Transition]*  Although heaven is very, very happy over our repentance, we all to often think of repentance in our own, earthly way. "What I'm concerned about is *his* repentance, not mine." We are constantly on the lookout for *others* to repent, especially others who have sinned against us. This alone, concern for *others* to repent—for *others* to take the blame, it's a big, messy package—has consumed our thoughts since the Fall. In fact, listen to Adam after he ate the forbidden fruit: **"** ***The woman*** **whom you gave to be with me,** ***she*** **gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate"**  (Gen. 3:12b).

We are blessed this morning for the Holy Gospel to give us a much-needed correction:


\[1] There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. \[2] And he answered them, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way? \[3] No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. (Luke 13:1–3)

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
