# JOY BEFORE THE ANGELS, JOY BEFORE THE FATHER

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, we're in the middle of Lent and today's theme is *joy*, just like joy is the theme for the Third Sunday in Advent. How often do we hear the joy of the lost sheep being found? **"I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents"**  (Luke 15:10). That's from the beginning of Luke, chapter 15. Then we have the joy of the lost coin being found.
> **Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it? And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, "Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost." Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.**  (Luke 15:8–10)

So we are told about the joy before the angels over one sinner who repents. In today's Holy Gospel we are told about the joy before the Father over one sinner who repents.

The worst thing about it is that He tries to make us celebrate even if we don't want to.


**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

## Notes
Isaiah 12:1
\[1] You will say in that day:
“I will give thanks to you, O LORD,
for though you were angry with me,
your anger turned away,
that you might comfort me. (ESV)

2 Corinthians 5:17
\[17] Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. (ESV)

2 Corinthians 5:21
\[21] For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. (ESV)

Luke 14:26–28
\[26] “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. \[27] Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple. \[28] For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? (ESV)

Luke 14:33
\[33] So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple. (ESV)

Luke 15:7
\[7] Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance. (ESV)

From last week's sermon:

One question that may bother us is "Have I repented well enough?" Turn to Luke, chapter 23 and behold the thief who turns to our crucified Lord and says simply, **"Jesus, remember me when You come into your kingdom"**  (Luke 23:42). Turn to 2 Samuel, chapter 12 and hear how the poor, miserable sinner King David repents: **"I have sinned against the LORD"**  is his simple confession to Nathan, no more, no less. **And Nathan \[says] to David, "The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die"**  (2 Sam. 12:13). And our Lord says to the thief, **"Truly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise"**  (Luke 23:43).

From today's Holy Gospel:

Luke 15:21
\[21] And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ (ESV)
