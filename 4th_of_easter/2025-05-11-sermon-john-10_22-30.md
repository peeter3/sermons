# BELIEVE THE WORKS

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, when we celebrate Mother's Day, we remember all that our mother has done for us. I could go on and on with what my mother has done for me.
* She fed me.
* She clothed me.
* She loved me.

She's my Mom.

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
