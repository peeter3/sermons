# DO NOT BE AFRAID; FROM NOW ON YOU WILL BE CATCHING MEN.

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, here's something with which you may be familiar. You've been working hard and finally you get a break—you finally get that well-deserved break. *\[Relaxing sound]*  "Ah!" You turn around and who do you see? Someone who wants you to forget about that break and go out and work some more. This can cause hard feelings. "Don't you understand I'm taking a break? Go and bug someone else."

Now we can work hard at a lot of things, but I want to focus for today on what we might agree is "backbreaking work." *\[Illustration]*  I have a childhood recollection of backbreaking work—not that I was doing the work—there may have been a day when I thought that raking leaves was backbreaking work—but when it comes to real backbreaking work I read somewhere that farmers in Asia work bent-over all day in rice paddies. That, I imagined, was real backbreaking work. Fishermen in the Bible also do real backbreaking work, which brings us to
* Peter & Andrew
* James & John

two pairs of brothers, four of the apostles, who are known to have been fishermen—who made their living doing backbreaking work.

Since fishermen get special recognition in the Bible, I should mention that this influenced the ambitions I held for my children. I wanted Aadu and Jaan to be brother fishermen like James and John. I have a picture to prove it. When Aadu was two and Jaan was a baby, I took them to the fishing dock in Monterey, California to watch a fishing trawler unload its catch of red snapper; it happens to be one of Aadu's earliest childhood memories.

*\[Transition]*  But in our Holy Gospel, Peter, James, and John are not so fortunate: they have fished all night and have caught *nothing*. These men are not like Irene and me fishing off the rocks and catching a goby every two years. These apostles are professional fishermen—they know what they're doing, but this night they caught nothing.

They've worked hard, caught nothing, and now it's time to wash the nets and put them away. Now you know every once in a while filmmakers take artistic license when they write screenplays for Bible movies. These apostles do backbreaking work, and I would like to add that fishermen, and others that do such work, might be inclined to use coarse, direct language, especially when they're tired from working all night and have nothing to show for their work. Does not the prophet Isaiah support this point in the Old Testament lesson? **"Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips"**  (Is. 6:5a).

They've worked hard and caught nothing while Christ, on shore, has a crowd pressing in on Him to hear the Word of God. This crowd, no doubt, is also well aware that Jesus is able to heal anyone who is sick who is brought to Him; He also casts out demons who cry out loud to Him, **"You are the Son of God!"**  (Luke 4:41) The crowd cannot get enough of Jesus and they press in on Him just as the fishermen are wrapping it up after a long, fruitless night of backbreaking work. Jesus is getting real popular, real fast. He turns to Peter and says, "Peter, I need you to get back in the boat with me."

"Listen, Miracle Man, I've been up all night and it's time to go home. Better make this quick." (And this, I imagine, would be a toned-down version of what a tired fisherman would really say.)

Now our Lord teaches the people from the boat. What He actually teaches is likely what we will hear in next week's Holy Gospel from Luke, chapter 6. What He teaches, though, is the Word of God for He *is* God. What precious Words for the crowd to hear!

*\[Transition]*  But now come the Words for Peter to hear: **"Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch."**  And Simon Peter answers,
> **Master, we toiled all night and took nothing!**  ***But at your word I will let down the nets.***

And at this point, belovèd in the Lord, Scripture instructs us in a most beautiful way. This moment is precious to our faith in Jesus. We have Peter, ready to go home—Peter, perhaps tired and irritated—Peter doing something right for a change. He's tired, … *but now is the best time to listen to Jesus*. By the grace of the Spirit, Peter overcomes his fatigue *to nevertheless trust Christ at His Word*. This, belovèd in the Lord, is wonderful for us to always keep in our hearts: *without the Word of Christ, no one catches anything*.

"You be the fisherman and let Me do the rest. The care is mine; the work is yours." That is, Peter's job is put out into the deep and let down his nets as Christ has told Him; Christ is the One who fills the nets—He fills them to the point of breaking! Again, the next time we're weary, we pray for the Spirit to open our ears because Christ's Word is coming for our abundant blessing!

And when the blessing is ours as we have heard and believed His Word, let us remember and quickly confess the sinful words that bubbled up from our hearts and nearly jumped off our tongues to defile us. **"When Simon Peter saw \[all those fish], he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, 'Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.' "**

Having confessed our sin to Jesus we acknowledge that His forgiveness is not an *Aww, it's okay*. His forgiveness is even beyond backbreaking work on His part, *\[Crucifixion]*  though His body *is* broken. His forgiveness, on His part, is to suffer. His forgiveness, on His part, is to bear His Father's anger. Who is our heavenly Father angry at? Idolaters. His jealous anger is borne by His Son who willingly, without complaint, obediently to be forsaken by His


**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
