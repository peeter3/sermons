# THIS IS THE LORD'S DOING; IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES.

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, our Old Testament lesson this morning is from Isaiah, chapter 43, beginning with the sixteenth verse, but the first verses of chapter 43 may already be quite familiar to you.
> **But now thus says the LORD, he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: "Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you."**  (Is. 43:1–2)

When it comes to passing through the waters, we can never forget the LORD parting the Red Sea to let His Israel, His chosen people, through, and at the same time He destroyed Pharaoh's army (Ex. 14). As we approach Holy Week, we anticipate what our Lord Jesus is about to do: by His death and Resurrection He is about to overthrow Satan for us and throw death out the window. Immediately following the crossing of the Red Sea, though, in Exodus, chapter 15, is the Song of Moses—one of those passages which is a psalm worth learning even though is not in the book of Psalms. Aaron's sister Miriam, the prophetess, sang, **"Sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea"**  (Ex. 15:1, 21).

But when Israel was encamped *on the other side of the Red Sea*, they had no idea what was going to happen. What they did see, though, was every chariot in Egypt coming after them, lead by hard-hearted Pharaoh.
> **When Pharaoh drew near, the people of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they feared greatly. And the people of Israel cried out to the LORD. They said to Moses, "Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us in bringing us out of Egypt? Is not this what we said to you in Egypt: 'Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians'? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness."**  (Ex. 14:10–12)

They had no idea what was going to happen next.

As our Lord Jesus is about to enter into Jerusalem for the last time to be crucified, very few have an idea what is going to happen next. And more importantly, very few have an idea what is going to happen next even though it was all foretold of Christ by the prophets.

building a building is a picture that God chooses to use for His work among us. The text for the first sermon I ever wrote was this very picture, which we hear in 1 Peter, chapter 2.
> **As you come to Him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious, you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For it stands in Scripture: "Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in Him will not be put to shame."**  (1 Peter 2:4—6; Is. 28:16)

I was so excited to actually write a sermon, and I spent hours and hours crafting it. But much better than my sermon God is building a spiritual house of living stones, with Jesus Christ the cornerstone. THIS IS THE LORD'S DOING; IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES.

God is at work building His Church as we hear in today's Holy Gospel.
> **"The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone." Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.**

Yet this does not describe *con*struction—it describes the *de*struction of those who fall on the cornerstone of the building. Our Lord Jesus quotes **"The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone"**  straight out of Psalm 188. (We do well to learn the Psalms well so we know what our Lord is talking about half the time.)

But in order that we may learn what it means to fall on the cornerstone, our Lord gives us another metaphor—another picture: a vineyard where grapes are grown. There is the owner of the vineyard, the landlord, and there are the tenants, those who work in the owner's vineyard. This is a business arrangement. The vineyard belongs to the owner but the tenants work in the vineyard and the deal is this: the tenants work and get to keep part of the fruit in order to make a living; the other part they owe to the owner for rent. They don't pay cash for rent: the pay part of the grapes that they grow for rent. The owner knows what to do with the grapes—no doubt he has servants to stomp on the grapes with their (clean) feet and turn the grape juice into wine, which he can sell. This is day-to-day life in the Bible times and this is how Jesus teaches us about the kingdom of heaven, that we may understand it.


Psalm 118:22–24
\[22] The stone that the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone.
\[23] This is the LORD’s doing;
it is marvelous in our eyes.
\[24] This is the day that the LORD has made;
let us rejoice and be glad in it. (ESV)

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
