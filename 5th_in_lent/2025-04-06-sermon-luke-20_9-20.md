# THIS IS THE LORD'S DOING; IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES.

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, building a building is a picture that God chooses to use for His work among us. The text for the first sermon I ever wrote was this very picture, which we hear in 1 Peter, chapter 2.
> **As you come to Him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious, you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For it stands in Scripture: "Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in Him will not be put to shame."**  (1 Peter 2:4—6; Is. 28:16)

I was so excited to actually write a sermon, and I spent hours and hours crafting it. But much better than my sermon God is building a spiritual house of living stones, with Jesus Christ the cornerstone. THIS IS THE LORD'S DOING; IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES.

God is at work building His Church as we hear in today's Holy Gospel.
> **"The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone." Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.**

Yet this does not describe *con*struction—it describes the *de*struction of those who fall on the cornerstone of the building. Our Lord Jesus quotes **"The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone"**  straight out of Psalm 188. (We do well to learn the Psalms well so we know what our Lord is talking about half the time.)

But in order that we may learn what it means to fall on the cornerstone, our Lord gives us another metaphor—another picture: a vineyard where grapes are grown. There is the owner of the vineyard, the landlord, and there are the tenants, those who work in the owner's vineyard. This is a business arrangement. The vineyard belongs to the owner but the tenants work in the vineyard and the deal is this: the tenants work and get to keep part of the fruit in order to make a living; the other part they owe to the owner for rent. They don't pay cash for rent: the pay part of the grapes that they grow for rent. The owner knows what to do with the grapes—no doubt he has servants to stomp on the grapes with their (clean) feet and turn the grape juice into wine, which he can sell. This is day-to-day life in the Bible times and this is how Jesus teaches us about the kingdom of heaven, that we may understand it.


Psalm 118:22–24
\[22] The stone that the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone.
\[23] This is the LORD’s doing;
it is marvelous in our eyes.
\[24] This is the day that the LORD has made;
let us rejoice and be glad in it. (ESV)

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
