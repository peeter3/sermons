# THIS IS THE LORD'S DOING; IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES.

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord,

Psalm 118:22–24
\[22] The stone that the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone.
\[23] This is the LORD’s doing;
it is marvelous in our eyes.
\[24] This is the day that the LORD has made;
let us rejoice and be glad in it. (ESV)

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
