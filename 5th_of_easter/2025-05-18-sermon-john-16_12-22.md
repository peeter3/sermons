# NO ONE WILL TAKE YOUR JOY FROM YOU.

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord,

Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy. When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come, but when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world. So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you. (ESV)

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

1 Peter 1:3–5
\[3] Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, \[4] to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, \[5] who by God’s power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. (ESV)
