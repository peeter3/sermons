# REJOICE IN THAT DAY, AND LEAP FOR JOY.

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, my van is parked in the parking lot and it has 232,000 miles on it. I would like to make it to 300,000, but my mechanic told me this week that we may be getting to the point that pushing to 300,000 might not be the wisest financial move. Why push to 300,000? To save money, if possible–vehicles are expensive. But there is a joy of having had something that you have been able to rely on for a long time. And I do feel that way toward Ole Bessie, my van.

Our Holy Gospel for today is the Sermon on the Plain, recorded in Luke, chapter 6, that is similar to \[Sermon on the Mount] the Sermon on the Mount, recorded in Matthew, chapters 5–7, because they both begin with the Beatitudes.



**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

Jeremiah 17:9–10
\[9] The heart is deceitful above all things,
and desperately sick;
who can understand it?
\[10] “I the LORD search the heart
and test the mind,
to give every man according to his ways,
according to the fruit of his deeds.” (ESV)
