# MARY SAT AT THE LORD'S FEET AND LISTENED TO HIS TEACHING.

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, from where did you get your great ideas when you were a kid? "Mom, Bobby says that if you eat glue it won't hurt you—as long as you let it dry first."

"If Bobby told you to jump in a fire, would you do it?" In other words, "Why are you listening to Bobby? You better not listen to him if he's trying to get you to eat glue."

You better not listen to her—she may be a scammer.

You better not listen to him—he may be a drug dealer.

But these days we have *influencers*, and millions listen to them.

And then there are those who are "always right." Do we do well to listen to them? It depends. If they *think* they're always right, they may be the most dangerous of all.

John 6:68
\[68] Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, (ESV)

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

## Notes
Genesis 18:9–10
\[9] They said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” And he said, “She is in the tent.” \[10] The LORD said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife shall have a son.” And Sarah was listening at the tent door behind him. (ESV)

Genesis 18:14
\[14] **Is anything too hard for the LORD?**  At the appointed time I will return to you, about this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son.” (ESV)

Genesis 18:16–18
\[16] Then the men set out from there, and they looked down toward Sodom. And Abraham went with them to set them on their way. \[17] The LORD said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, \[18] seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? (ESV)

Genesis 18:20–22
\[20] Then the LORD said, “Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave, \[21] I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know.”
\[22] So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the LORD. (ESV)

Genesis 19:1–2
\[1] The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth \[2] and said, “My lords, please turn aside to your servant’s house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way.” They said, “No; we will spend the night in the town square.” (ESV)

Colossians 1:22
\[22] he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him, (ESV)

Jesus needed His flesh in order to die.
