# FOR THE FATHER HIMSELF LOVES YOU

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, *\[sing]*
> *Jesus loves me! This I know,* 
> *For the Bible tells me so.* 
> *Little ones to Him belong;* 
> *They are weak, but He is strong.*
>
> *Yes, Jesus loves me!* 
> *Yes, Jesus loves me!* 
> *Yes, Jesus loves me!* 
> *The Bible tells me so.*

Let us learn this song well and sing it often, **for while we were still sinners, Christ died for us**. (Rom. 5:8b). Scripture does clearly teach us that we are His sheep, His little ones, and He is our Good Shepherd who has laid down His life for us to protect us from the wolf (John 10). Jesus does love us dearly.

*\[Transition]*  But if that were the only hymn we sang, that would not be the whole counsel of God (Acts 20:27). Let us ever be reminded by *\[Gethsemane]*  our wonderful window how much Jesus also loves His Father. At Gethsemane our Lord prayed, **"Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me. Nevertheless, not My will, but Yours, be done"**  (Luke 22:42). Jesus also loves His Father dearly.

But notice that God the Father has no need of His Son's sacrificial love like we do. The Father has no sins to confess—He is holy—*we* are the sinners with unclean lips (Is. 6:5).

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
