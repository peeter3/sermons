# BUT LOVE YOUR ENEMIES AND EXPECT NOTHING IN RETURN

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, it may be the most distinguishing aspect of Christian character that we deal with our enemies differently. Say "I am a Christian" and the world knows, whether they've opened a Bible or not—
everyone has heard that we love our enemies and we turn the other cheek.

And so, in the name of Christ, let us hear again slowly that which He commands us to do:
* Love your enemies.
* Do good to those who hate you.

Has our Lord told us to do this, or is this just advice for a more pious life? I would have you know that this has been debated in church history. We have the text before us: there is no suggestion that this is mere advice: it is our Lord's command. They will know we are Christians by our love for our enemies.

We continue.
* Bless those who curse you.
* Pray for those who abuse you.

Let us pause on that command. To be abused at the hands of someone else, whether verbal or physical, is terrible and should never happen. The Bible teaches us that God will take vengeance for us (Rom. 12:19; Deut. 32:35)–it is not for us to seek revenge. … Doesn't the Lord realize the world we live in? Belovèd in the Lord, He knows *exactly* the world we live in.

*\[Transition]*  And we will always have Joseph from our Old Testament lesson, whose own brothers abused him. They were jealous of him, for Joseph was Dad's favorite son. The Bible tells us, **"Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age"**  (Gen. 37:3). These older brothers threw Joseph into a pit and then sold their little brother to slave traders who sold him to Potiphar, the captain of Pharaoh's guard (Gen. 39:1).

In our Old Testament lesson, in Genesis, chapter 45, Joseph is now face-to-face with his brothers who abused him. He is face-to-face with Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah (from whom Christ is to be born), Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, and Zebulun. These brothers fear revenge but what does Joseph say to them?
> **I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. And now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here,** ***for God sent me before you to preserve life*.**  (Gen. 45:4b–5)

Joseph is not angry. Joseph is not nursing a grudge. Joseph is *chill*!Joseph sees that it is God's good and gracious will to keep his brothers alive in famine, and Joseph can live with it. This is, in fact, God's plan: Joseph lives, his brothers live—everyone lives. God's plan is *to preserve life*. God planned to have mercy on Joseph's cruel brothers and keep them alive, *even if it meant that Joseph would be abused by them*. And in our Old Testament lesson, Joseph sees God's plan. Belovèd in the Lord, God is always planning to show mercy in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and Joseph is a type of Christ. We have a view into God's heart that all along He wanted to have mercy on those brothers who hated Joseph.

\[Transition] When our Lord Jesus teaches, He's behind it. When our Lord Jesus teaches, His Words don't have force because He's opinionated. You could say His Words do have force because He's wise. But the point is that His Words have force because they accomplish what they say. He will accomplish all of it

*\[Transition]*  I will begin to tell the story of a Christian who lived in the world before us–a man named Polycarp, who was a disciple of the apostle John himself.


**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
