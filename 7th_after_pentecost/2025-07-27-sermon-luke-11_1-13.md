# PRAY THIS WAY

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, in our Holy Gospel today our Lord teaches us to pray the Lord's Prayer, which is as widely known as can be. There is a parallel passage in the Sermon on the Mount, in Matthew, chapter 6. *\[Sermon on the Mount. Explain the window.]*  Today's sermon, therefore, is on prayer.

I invite you to turn your attention first to these Words of Christ: **"When you pray, say"** —not " *If* you pray"—**"** ***When*** **your pray."**  You will pray—it's inevitable—you will pray sooner or later. Even atheists pray in the foxhole. Prayer is assumed or implied throughout the Bible, not just when our Lord says in our Holy Gospel, **"When your pray."**  If I were to say prayer is not an option—you *will* pray—that would make prayer a law, which is not what prayer is.

But for those who would like to take prayer as an option—for those who might hesitate to ask God for something—who might prefer not to pray—we have the example from the Bible of King Ahaz, in Isaiah, chapter 7, which we normally hear at Christmastime:
> **The LORD spoke to Ahaz: "Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven." But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test."**  (Is. 7:10–12)

Ahaz did not want to ask anything of the LORD even though the LORD had made him the offer to ask for anything. Nevertheless, Ahaz did not want to pray. He made a false show of piety when he said, **"I will not put the LORD to the test,"**  as if it were polite on his part not to bother God. Though Ahaz didn't ask anything, Isaiah still gave a reply from the LORD—*\[ask]*  do you remember the LORD's reply? **"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel"**  (Is. 7:14b)—the LORD's reply was to proclaim the birth of Jesus anyway. Alleluia!

And so it is that even if we do not ask, the Lord will answer. This is reflected in the teaching of the Small Catechism, for example, in the Second Petition.
> **Thy kingdom come.** What does this mean? The kingdom of God certainly comes by itself *without our prayer*, but we pray in this petition that it may come to us also.

Our asking for God's kingdom to come is not necessary for it to come—God's kingdom comes whether we ask for it or not. But note that Christ, in giving us the Lord's Prayer, teaches us to ask for it anyway—prayer is never out of order—ask that the Spirit brighten our hearts to receive Jesus as our Savior, making us citizens of the kingdom of heaven.

And so, having brought up Ahaz and checked the Small Catechism, let us move on to more examples of prayer found in the Bible. Ahaz made a false show of piety by indicating that he did not want to bother God, but God, in His Word, gives us the persistent widow as a model for Christian prayer.
> **In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man. And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, "Give me justice against my adversary." For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, "Though I neither fear God nor respect man, yet** ***because this widow keeps bothering me*, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming."**  (Luke 18:2–5)

I hope you've heard this before. Our Lord teaches us to pray like a nagging widow—this is prayer that pleases the Lord.

And to continue with this theme, our Lord gives us in today's Holy Gospel the example of the impudent, that is, the rude friend banging on the door at night asking for three loaves of bread.

Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, "Friend, lend me three loaves, for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him"; and he will answer from within, "Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything"? I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence he will rise and give him whatever he needs. \[9] And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.

*\[Ask]*  Question: is God bothered by our prayers? No! No, in no way, God is not at all bothered by our prayers: He *wants* us—He *invites* us to bother Him all we want. See if the Lord ever tires of our prayers.

Yet there are prayers that the Lord may tire of, as indicated by the following Scriptures:



> **To keep me from becoming conceited …, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited. Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.**  (2 Cor. 12:7a, 7c–9)


There is no indication that God is angry with Abraham for talking Him down. Abraham is pleading for God to show mercy, which is something we know is in God's character.

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

Examples of prayer from the Bible.

Luke 18:2–5
\[2] He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man. \[3] And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’ \[4] For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect man, \[5] yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming.’” (ESV)

The impudent man in today's Holy Gospel.

Walt brought this up as an example of prayer:

2 Corinthians 12:7–9
\[7] So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited. \[8] Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. \[9] But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. (ESV)

Which brings us to Christ praying in Gethsemane: Luke 22:42
\[42] saying, “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.” (ESV)

St. Paul puts it this way in 1 Thessalonians, chapter 5: **"Pray without ceasing"**  (1 Thess. 5:17). If you're praying anyway, you might as well never stop.

And, of course, our Old Testament lesson. Abraham talked God down for the cause of mercy.

The prayer of a wicked man is counted as sin.

Psalm 109:7
\[7] When he is tried, let him come forth guilty;
let his prayer be counted as sin! (ESV)
