# PRAY THIS WAY

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, in our Holy Gospel today our Lord give us the Lord's Prayer, so today's sermon is on prayer. I want to first draw your attention to these Words of Christ: **"When you pray, say"** —not " *If* you pray"—**"** ***When*** **your pray."**  You will pray sooner or later. Prayer is not an option, but I do not want to put prayer forward as a requirement, either, making it a law. St. Paul puts it well when he says, in 1 Thessalonians, chapter 5: **"Pray without ceasing"**  (1 Thess. 5:17).

There is not indication that God is angry with Abraham for talking Him down. Abraham is pleading for God to show mercy, which is something we know is in God's character.

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

## Notes
Examples of prayer from the Bible.

Luke 18:2–5
\[2] He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man. \[3] And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’ \[4] For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect man, \[5] yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming.’” (ESV)

The impudent man in today's Holy Gospel.

Walt brought this up as an example of prayer:

2 Corinthians 12:7–9
\[7] So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited. \[8] Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. \[9] But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. (ESV)

Which brings us to Christ praying in Gethsemane: Luke 22:42
\[42] saying, “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.” (ESV)

And, of course, our Old Testament lesson. Abraham talked God down for the cause of mercy.

The prayer of a wicked man is counted as sin.

Psalm 109:7
\[7] When he is tried, let him come forth guilty;
let his prayer be counted as sin! (ESV)
