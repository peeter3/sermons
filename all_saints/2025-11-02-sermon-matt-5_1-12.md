# BLESSÈD BECAUSE OF JESUS

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Gracious Father, grant that we truly be blessèd in the name of Your Son, Jesus. Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, All Saints' Day is the celebration of all saints, all of God's holy ones who are *\[font]*  washed and believe in Jesus for the forgiveness of their sins. All saints include the saints who have gone before us and rest from their labors, of whom we will remember during our prayers those who have gone to sleep in Jesus during the past year.

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

Psalm 51:14
\[14] Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,
O God of my salvation,
and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness. (ESV)

Revelation 6:9–11
\[9] When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they had borne. \[10] They cried out with a loud voice, “O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?” \[11] Then they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been. (ESV)
