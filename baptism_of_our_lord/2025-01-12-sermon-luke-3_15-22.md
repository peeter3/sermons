# I GIVE YOU WHAT IS MINE AND TAKE WHAT IS YOURS.

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, we have before us with Christ's Baptism that declares what wonderful things He has come to do for us. For our own Baptism in Christ's name we can hear our Lord declare this promise: **"He that believes and baptized shall be saved"**  (Mark 16:16). This is the promise of *our* Baptism. What we hear said at Christ's Baptism is the Father saying *to Christ* **"You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."** Though there is no *explicit* promise made directly to us at Christ's Baptism, the *implicit* promise made to us is breathtaking.

We have John the Baptist baptizing sinners in the Jordan River.
> **You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruits in keeping with repentance.**  (Luke 3:7b–8a)


Still they came to him and he baptized them. There are but two parties involved: John and all the brood of vipers fleeing from God's wrath against their sin. They are all we are to be concerned with until a third party enters: Christ, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29).

Between these three parties there is, however, a sharp distinction that puts two on one side and one on the other. Christ is without sin; John the Baptist is like the brood of vipers—John himself is also a sinner. The distinction is that Christ alone is different from all the others: He is holy—He is without sin; the others are not.

Luke 3:16
\[16] John answered them all, saying, “I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. (ESV)

We flee to our Baptism.

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

## Notes
Here are verses about the second servant (Christ).

Isaiah 41:8–10
\[8] But you, Israel, my servant,
Jacob, whom I have chosen,
the offspring of Abraham, my friend;
\[9] you whom I took from the ends of the earth,
and called from its farthest corners,
saying to you, “You are my servant,
I have chosen you and not cast you off”;
\[10] fear not, for I am with you;
be not dismayed, for I am your God;
I will strengthen you, I will help you,
I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. (ESV)

Isaiah 42:1–4
\[1] Behold my servant, whom I uphold,
my chosen, in whom my soul delights;
I have put my Spirit upon him;
he will bring forth justice to the nations.
\[2] He will not cry aloud or lift up his voice,
or make it heard in the street;
\[3] a bruised reed he will not break,
and a faintly burning wick he will not quench;
he will faithfully bring forth justice.
\[4] He will not grow faint or be discouraged
till he has established justice in the earth;
and the coastlands wait for his law. (ESV)

Isaiah 43:1b
\[1b] “Fear not, for I have redeemed you;
I have called you by name, you are mine. (ESV)

Isaiah 43:4
\[4] Because you are precious in my eyes,
and honored, and I love you,
I give men in return for you,
peoples in exchange for your life. (ESV)

Ultimately, our Lord gives Himself in exchange for our life.

Isaiah 43:21
\[21] the people whom I formed for myself
that they might declare my praise. (ESV)

John 1:32–34
\[32] And John bore witness: “I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him. \[33] I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ \[34] And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.” (ESV)
