Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord,

Luke 3:16

## Notes
Here are verses about the second servant (Christ).

Isaiah 41:8–10
\[8] But you, Israel, my servant,
Jacob, whom I have chosen,
the offspring of Abraham, my friend;
\[9] you whom I took from the ends of the earth,
and called from its farthest corners,
saying to you, “You are my servant,
I have chosen you and not cast you off”;
\[10] fear not, for I am with you;
be not dismayed, for I am your God;
I will strengthen you, I will help you,
I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. (ESV)

Isaiah 42:1–4
\[1] Behold my servant, whom I uphold,
my chosen, in whom my soul delights;
I have put my Spirit upon him;
he will bring forth justice to the nations.
\[2] He will not cry aloud or lift up his voice,
or make it heard in the street;
\[3] a bruised reed he will not break,
and a faintly burning wick he will not quench;
he will faithfully bring forth justice.
\[4] He will not grow faint or be discouraged
till he has established justice in the earth;
and the coastlands wait for his law. (ESV)

John 1:32–34
\[32] And John bore witness: “I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him. \[33] I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ \[34] And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.” (ESV)
