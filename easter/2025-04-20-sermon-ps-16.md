# REFUGE IN CHRIST'S RESURRECTION

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord,

Luke 24:5–7
\[5] And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? \[6] He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, \[7] that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.” (ESV)

John 2:19–22
\[19] Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” \[20] The Jews then said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?” \[21] But he was speaking about the temple of his body. \[22] When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken. (ESV)

\[Acts 13:34] And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way,
“‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.’ (This may be a reference to Is. 55:3.)


\[35] Therefore he says also in another psalm,
“‘You will not let your Holy One see corruption.’

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

## Notes
John 2:19–22
\[19] Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” \[20] The Jews then said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?” \[21] But he was speaking about the temple of his body. \[22] When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken. (ESV)

John 20:8–9
\[8] Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; \[9] for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. (ESV)

This Scripture may be Ps. 16.

Acts 13:28–39
\[28] And though they found in him no guilt worthy of death, they asked Pilate to have him executed. \[29] And when they had carried out all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb. \[30] But God raised him from the dead, \[31] and for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people. \[32] And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, \[33] this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm,
“‘You are my Son,
today I have begotten you.’


\[34] And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way,
“‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.’


\[35] Therefore he says also in another psalm,
“‘You will not let your Holy One see corruption.’


\[36] For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption, \[37] but he whom God raised up did not see corruption. \[38] Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, \[39] and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses. (ESV)

1 Corinthians 15:20
\[20] But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. (ESV)
