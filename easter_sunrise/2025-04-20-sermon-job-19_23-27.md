# I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVES
Belovèd in the Lord, what do I know? I know my name. I know Trina's name. I know Trina's birthday. I know my own birthday. The Lord knows the day I'll die. And when that day comes, there will likely appear a headstone *\[point to Section M]*  in Section M engraved with all the things that I do know.

But there's more that *we* know. We know what Job proclaims:
> **Oh that my words were written!** 
> **Oh that they were inscribed in a book!** 
> **Oh that with an iron pen and lead**
> **they were** ***engraved in the rock forever*!** 
> **For I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVES,** 
> **and at the last He will stand upon the earth.**

Christ, who bore our sins on the Cross and died, *lives*. He is risen! He is risen indeed! Alleluia! Engrave that on a rock—engrave that on every headstone of every believer in Christ: **I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVES**. Belovèd in the Lord, our Redeemer Jesus lives. He has redeemed us, lost and condemned people, purchased and won us from all sins, from death, and from the power of the devil.

On this day that Jesus rose from the grave, he won for us *the* decisive victory over the devil: the serpent's head is crushed. The devil's head was crushed already on Good Friday when Christ bore our sins on the Cross, but today there is no doubt about His victory. Back on the Wednesday of Holy Week the devil had entered Judas to engineer Christ's death (Luke 22:3). As Christ died in agony on Good Friday it did appear that the devil was victorious. As Christ's lifeless body was laid in the tomb by Joseph of Arimathea (Luke 23:50–53) it did not appear that Christ was victorious, though He already was.

Belovèd in the Lord, remember Christ's weakness and the death which He died. But remember also that at the moment He died the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, remember that the earth shook and the rocks were split, and remember especially that many bodies of the saints were raised from the dead and appeared in Jerusalem at the moment Christ died (Matt. 27:51–53). *He turns death into new life.*

And so, the devil's head was crushed on Good Friday, but, boy, do we ever know it when our Lord is resurrected from the dead in a brand-new body! It is clear that nothing that the devil threw at Christ stuck. The Bible is clear about the devil's status in the world today:
> **Rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath,** ***because he knows that his time is short*!**  (Rev. 12:12)

Though the devil still works woe on earth, Christ's victory has marked the devil for eternal torment, along with the beast and the false prophet (Rev. 20:10). Though it is God's good and gracious will to allow the devil to trouble us, what we will learn from our trials is only that Christ had defeated him. The devil knows his time is short.

For Job's in a bit of trouble but he *knows* he has a Redeemer to get him out of it.

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
