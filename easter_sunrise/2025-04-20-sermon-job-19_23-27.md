# I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVES
Belovèd in the Lord, what do you know? You may know your name. You may know your parents. You may know your birthday. But **I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVES.**

Look around and what do you see? Graves, headstones. And what is etched on a headstone?
* Name
* Birth year
* Year the person fell asleep in the Lord
* Sometimes names of family

I've seen a headstone in Pennsylvania for a husband and wife, and all their children's names are listed in the middle. In short, only those things *that we know* about a person are engraved on a headstone. Well, according to Job, there is something else to engrave:
> **Oh that my words were written!**
> **Oh that they were inscribed in a book!**
> **Oh that with an iron pen and lead**
> **they were** ***engraved in the rock forever*!**
> **For I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVES,**
> **and at the last he will stand upon the earth.**

For Job's in a bit of trouble but he *knows* he has a Redeemer to get him out of it.

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
