# LIFT HIM UP, THAT'S ALL

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  We remember, Lord Jesus, that You were lifted up for us upon the Cross to bear our sins. May our hearts always be drawn to You. Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, we are to lift up the name of Jesus everywhere. Having just had the privilege to lead chapel at Luther Memorial School, I am keenly aware of something Martin Luther said, and that is that the #1 most important thing to teach a child is to pray in the name of Jesus. We are to lift up the name of Jesus everywhere, but it is breathtaking to behold what a blessing it is to the life of a child *\[Baptism]*  to call upon Jesus from an early age. We can only rejoice in Dominic, our Sunday School student. Norm asked him last Sunday, "Dominic, what word do you want to write?"

"Jesus." Dominic is going to go far.

But, of course, it is not only children who are to lift up the name of Jesus. I should point out that on Cypress Avenue we have a fine Christian congregation, *Lift Him Up* Apostolic Faith Church. I have been invited there many times and I have gone several times. Our brothers and sisters at Lift Him Up are lifting up Jesus all the time and are a blessing to our neighborhood. But there it is, right in the church's name: Lift Him Up. Lift up the name of Jesus.

Now this is as good a time as any to warn you about *not* lifting up the name of Jesus. For there is no lack of "spiritual" talk, and I, from time to time, am sought out—especially if it is known that I'm a pastor—I am sought out for spiritual conversations. Beware! If the name of Jesus is not lifted up in a spiritual conversation—if His name is avoided, perhaps—remember the Words of our Lord concerning the Holy Spirit: **"The Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send** ***in My name*, He will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all** ***that I have said to you*"**  (John 14:26). A "spiritual" conversation that steers away from Jesus *has nothing to do with the Holy Spirit*. So beware.

Now for me personally, when I hear the words *Lift Him up*, I think of a song by Washington Phillips, called *LIFT HIM UP, THAT'S ALL*. You may not have even heard of this song. *LIFT HIM UP, THAT'S ALL* came to my mind quickly when I read today's Holy Gospel, and there it is: I made it the sermon title because this song has stuck with me. I often sing it to myself: *\[sing]*
> *Oh, LIFT HIM UP, THAT'S ALL,* 
> *Lift Him up in His word,* 
> *If you'll tell the name of Jesus everywhere,* 
> *If you'll keep His name a-ringin' everywhere that you go,* 
> *He will draw men unto Him.*

I will probably be singing this song till my dying day, and it does underline that we are to lift up the name of Jesus everywhere that we go and that He desires to draw men unto Him, and this is *men* in the wide sense, every man, woman, and child.

So, on the subject of lifting up the name of Jesus, we do well to listen to Him speak for Himself. Today we have the opportunity, and here we go. Our Lord Jesus says,
> **The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.**

This verse, in case you wanted to know, *\[cemetery]*  is often read in the cemetery at a committal.
> **Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.**

This is a parallel passage for last week's Holy Gospel, so we are picking up where last week's sermon left off: COUNT THE COST OF DISCIPLESHIP. But it is of great comfort to know that as we follow Jesus, no matter what it may cost us, we are with Him and He is with us. We are also told that it is our greatest honor to follow God's Son.

Our Lord continues,
> **Now is My soul troubled. And what shall I say? "Father, save Me from this hour"? But for this purpose I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name.**

These words of our Lord bring to our remembrance His prayer to His Father *\[Gethsemane]*  at Gethsemane. But here we see that our Lord is laser-focused on the hour set before Him by His Father, and we all know what that is: the Cross. Our Lord Jesus is laser-focused on the Cross—this is going to be a big, difficult job, so much so that His soul is troubled—*\[understatement]*  this is going to be no fun. His laser-focus on the Cross also reveals to us His love for His Father, whose name He wants to glorify at the Cross.

This particular attention of our Lord for the Cross is significant—so significant that we picked a special Sunday in the church year and called it Holy Cross Sunday—today, September 14, is Holy Cross Sunday.
> **"Father, glorify your name." Then a voice came from heaven: "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again." …** \[Then our Lord tells us,]  **"This voice has come for your sake, not mine. Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out."**

Belovèd in the Lord, the work of Christ on the Cross brings judgment on the world, *\[humor]*  in case you're interested in world affairs.

But what about the devil? I also warn you to be wary of any "spiritual" conversations that deny the devil. It just so happens that I visited a friend this week right here in Old Brooklyn, who shared with me what he's been hearing from YouTube videos—that Satan is not an individual but more a personification of evil. As he described the video, it sounded to me from my seminary training like Gnosticism. I thank God for Professor Weinrich that I was able to recognize it, but beware: Gnosticism has not gone away! I did not have the opportunity to share this Scripture with my friend, but I'll share it with you:
> **The LORD said to Satan, "From where have you come?" Satan answered the LORD and said, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."**  (Job 1:7)

In the book of Job, we have a record of a face-to-face conversation between God and Satan. Scripture teaches that Satan is a creature who rebelled against God. But the power of the Cross is to cast Satan, who is also called *the ruler of this world*, out of the world! Claim the power of the Cross, lift up the name of Jesus the next time you're depressed watching the news or even horrified by what you've seen with your own eyes.

Continuing in our Holy Gospel, our Lord Jesus now says,
> **"And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to Myself."** ***He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die*.**

Belovèd in the Lord, here we learn two things straight from our Lord Jesus Christ:
* When He is lifted up, all people will be drawn to Him.
* This lifting up, to which He Himself refers, is not His Ascension, not even His Resurrection, *but this lifting up is specifically His Cross*.

Here our Lord teaches us that when we lift up His name, do not neglect anything from His Word, but *do lift up the Cross*.

*\[Crucifixion]*  Belovèd in the Lord, what do we see at the Cross that would draw us to Jesus? Here's on thing we see as His body is lifted up: *my sins* lifted Him up on that Cross. Scripture clearly tells us that **He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our sins** (Is. 53). As He is lifted up, I acknowledge that He is nailed to the Cross in punishment for my sins—*my sins* attached Him to *that Cross*, and now the Roman soldiers are lifting Him up with my sins and anchoring the Cross in the posthole. There He is, the Word made flesh by whom all things were made (John 1) dying on the Cross being punished for my own fault. He's doing this because of me.

And now, belovèd in the Lord, here is why I can say, *belovèd in the Lord*—He's doing it because of you. He loves you and He loves every sinner. He bore all of our sins. This … is … true … love. This is what draws everyone to Him. He gave up His life so that we can live forever—*\[Resurrection]*  live like Him forever. **The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

## Notes
*Lift Him Up*, That's All lyrics:

When Jesus was around here on this land
He certainly did do His Father's command
Because He knew that He was His Father's only Son
He came to draw men unto Him

*Refrain* Oh, lift Him up that's all
Lift Him up in His Word
If you'll tell the Name of Jesus everywhere
If you'll keep His Name a-ringin' everywhere that you go
He will draw men unto Him

When Jesus met the woman at Jacob's well
He said He did have her a sweet message to tell
The woman commenced wonderin' cause she seen He was a Jew
He came to draw men unto Him *Refrain*

When she learned that it was Jesus she ran into the town
Sayin', "Come and see a man who told me all that I have done
Is this not the messenger which is called Christ?"
He came to draw men unto Him *Refrain*

When He asked her for some water, her sins she tried to hide
She commenced telling my Savior all about race pride
But a woman if she just only knew the gift of God
I came to draw men unto Me *Refrain*
