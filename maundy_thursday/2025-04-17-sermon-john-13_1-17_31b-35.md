# THE ONE WHO HAS BATHED DOES NOT NEED TO WASH, EXCEPT FOR HIS FEET.

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, on the day that our Lord instituted Holy Communion, our Lord also washed His disciples' feet.



**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

## Notes
Footnote from *Lutheran Study Bible* for John 13:10:
> The disciples already received forgiveness of sins—spiritual cleansing—from Jesus. But just as a traveler might regularly need a foot washing, so Christians must lead a life of daily repentance (contrition and faith).
