# I SAW SATAN FALL LIKE LIGHTNING FROM HEAVEN

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, you have probably heard this verse before from Hebrews, chapter 13: **"Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares"**  (Heb. 13:2).

Do all the angels serve these purposes of God? No. Some angels (the devil and the fallen angels) rebelled against God and now seek to destroy everything that is good, especially faith in Christ.[^1]

> **I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day.**  (Jude 5–6)


**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep \[our] hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

## Notes
Psalm 34:7
\[7] The angel of the LORD encamps
around those who fear him, and delivers them. (ESV)

Daniel 9:20–23
\[20] While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my plea before the LORD my God for the holy hill of my God, \[21] while I was speaking in prayer, **the man Gabriel**, whom I had seen in the vision at the first, came to me in swift flight at the time of the evening sacrifice. \[22] He made me understand, speaking with me and saying, “O Daniel, I have now come out to give you insight and understanding. \[23] At the beginning of your pleas for mercy a word went out, and I have come to tell it to you, for you are greatly loved. Therefore consider the word and understand the vision. (ESV)

Then Gabriel tells Daniel about the 70 weeks. The traditional Christian interpretation is that the Messiah of 9:25–26 is Jesus Christ. The 70 weeks culminate with the first Advent of Christ.

![Interpretation 1](https://church.pirn.us/70-weeks-1.png)

A typological interpretation of the 70 weeks is that the vision covers the entire time between the time of Daniel and the second coming of Christ.

Luke 11:17–20
\[17] But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household falls. \[18] And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul. \[19] And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. \[20] But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. (ESV)

1 Corinthians 10:18–22
\[18] Consider the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? \[19] What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? \[20] No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. \[21] You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. \[22] Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? (ESV)

Hebrews 12:22–24
\[22] But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, \[23] and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, \[24] and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel. (ESV)

Hebrews 13:2
\[2] Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. (ESV)
