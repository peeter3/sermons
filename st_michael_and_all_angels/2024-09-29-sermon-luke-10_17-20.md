# I SAW SATAN FALL LIKE LIGHTNING FROM HEAVEN

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Bless us, Lord, Jesus with supreme confidence in Your name. Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, I hope you have heard this verse before from Hebrews, chapter 13: **"Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby** ***some have entertained angels unawares*"**  (Heb. 13:2). This verse has caught the attention of many and it has been experienced by many. You may have seen an angel before and not known it. Many have shared with me that they believe they *have* seen an angel—it's nothing unusual. Angels are heavenly creatures that can look like us, so you never know—you might have seen one or even shown hospitality to a heavenly guest.

Angels are heavenly creatures. We behold a host of earthly creatures—we see turtles and chipmunks and walleye—but there is also a host of *heavenly* creatures that we don’t see unless God makes a special provision to show them to us. In Nehemiah, chapter 9, the Levites lead the Jewish people to pray,
> **You are the LORD, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens,**  ***with all their host*, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them; and you preserve all of them; and the host of heaven worships you.**  (Neh. 9:6)

Angels are a heavenly host—a heavenly army under God's command. Our Lord Jesus Himself says during His Passion,
> **Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?**  (Matt. 26:53)

None of this may be news to you. But here is something about the angels you may not have thought about: *the angels can only serve the Gospel of Jesus Christ*. For St. Paul tells the churches in Galatia, **“If we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed”** (Gal. 1:8). There is no other Gospel than that *\[Cross]*  Christ died for sinners and lives again for us. The angels serve the Gospel.

The Bible also warns that there are dangerous doctrines that go *against* the Gospel. St. Paul again warns us, **“I appeal to you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles** ***contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught*; avoid them”** (Rom. 16:17). For example, a doctrine contrary to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and against Creation itself is that a man can marry a man and a woman marry a woman. Watch out! There are a bewildering number of obstacles contrary to the Gospel, and, Lord, give us Your Spirit and help us to avoid all dangerous doctrines!

Which brings up a question: do all the angels serve the good and gracious purpose of God? No. Some angels (the devil and the fallen angels) rebelled against God and now seek to destroy everything that is good—*they especially seek to destroy faith in Christ*. [^1] There is mention of these rebellious angels in the book of Jude, the book right before the book of Revelation.
> **I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day.**  (Jude 5–6)

We should be very concerned about Satan and His angels. By the grace of the Spirit, we need to be wise against Satan and His ways. How can we witness the evil that man commits against his fellow man and deny the existence of Satan and his angels? They are real and they are dangerous … but *not* dangerous to us who belong to Jesus.

Belovèd in the Lord, listen to this good news from the mouth of our Lord Jesus, recorded in today's Holy Gospel. Our Lord tells us,
> **I SAW SATAN FALL LIKE LIGHTNING FROM HEAVEN. Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and** ***nothing shall hurt you*. Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.**  (Luke 10:18–20)

Belovèd in the Lord, having confessed our sins to God, let us *\[Cross]*  rejoice in our Savior Jesus who was delivered up for our trespasses and *\[Resurrection]*  raised on the third day for our justification (Rom. 4:25). Who is Jesus? *He's the firstborn from the dead* (Col. 1:18)—He came out of the grave alive. Alleluia! And who are we who belong to Jesus? We are the second- and third- and fourth-born from the dead—we are *\[Baptism]*  marked by Baptism in Jesus' name and enrolled in the countless list of names who have conquered death and entered eternal life in heaven. *Our names—thanks be to Jesus!—are written in heaven.*  All Saints is around the corner, and we will go over on November 3 that list of names written in heaven—over that small part of the heavenly list that includes those who fell asleep in the Lord among us during the past church year. *Our* names, by faith in Jesus, are on that list, ready to be read some day at an All Saints service.

Our Lord makes the point to us in today's Holy Gospel, and we can do no better than to listen to Him: *Satan is already defeated for us*. He has been thrown down from heaven and can no longer accuse us. He has not been thrown in the lake of fire yet (Rev. 20:10), but He *is defeated*. Christ defeated the devil for us already with His death and Resurrection. Furthermore, we who belong to Jesus have His authority over any of the angels or demons or schemes of the devil.

Belovèd in the Lord, keep this in mind when we celebrate the Reformation at St. James on October 27. On that day we will sing *A Mighty Fortress Is Our God*, and the end of the third stanza we will sing, "One little word can fell him," that is, one little word can fell the devil. *\[Ask]*  What is that one little word that makes the devil fall over? *The name of Jesus*. Christ defeated the devil for us already with His death and Resurrection. It's exciting to have Christ's name as our own and to have power in the name of Jesus over the devil, but our Lord tells us not to rejoice over that power so much as rejoice instead that we *are saved* from the devil, from death, from hell. Belovèd in the Lord, we're living a new life *now* (Rom. 6:4). By the grace of the Spirit may our rejoicing be properly placed and Satan be kept away from us as well.

Satan is no longer in heaven. **"I SAW SATAN FALL LIKE LIGHTNING FROM HEAVEN,"**  says the Lord. We have seen Satan in heaven before accusing Job (Job 1–2), but those days are over. Our Epistle lesson from Revelation, chapter 12 gives us the detail.
> **War arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon. And the dragon and his angels fought back, but he was defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.**  (Rev. 12:7–9)

The good angels, led by the archangel Michael, have already defeated Satan and the evil angels and thrown them down here to earth. It is said that a third of the angels were thrown down with Satan (Rev. 12:4). While they are here, what is their goal? *Their goal is to destroy faith in Jesus through deception and murder*. (We know how the devil works (John 8:44).) And where people are dying, and where people are deceiving each other, there faith in Jesus is under attack. Beware of anything that kills and beware of lies. Continuing from our Epistle lesson,
> **I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God. And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death."**  (Rev. 12:10–11)

Belovèd in the Lord, the blood of the Lamb, *\[Cross]*  in which we believe and *\[altar]*  of which we partake in Holy Communion for the constant forgiveness of our sins—the blood of Jesus is the testimony against which Satan's accusations *have absolutely zero power*. He must leave and find someone else for *we belong to Christ!*  And as guilty as we are according to the surveillance video, the blood of Christ, in which we believe and of which we partake—*the blood of Jesus Christ has the final word for all sinners who would only believe*. The name of Jesus, *\[font]*  to Whom we belong, has the final word over Satan and all his power. Christ is our life.
> *And take they our life,* 
> *Goods, fame, child, and wife,* 
> *Though these all be gone,* 
> *Our vict'ry has been won;* 
> *The Kingdom ours remaineth.*

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep \[our] hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.



## Notes
Nehemiah 9:6
\[6] “You are the LORD, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them; and you preserve all of them; and the host of heaven worships you.

Psalm 34:7
\[7] The angel of the LORD encamps
around those who fear him, and delivers them. (ESV)

Daniel 9:20–23
\[20] While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my plea before the LORD my God for the holy hill of my God, \[21] while I was speaking in prayer, **the man Gabriel**, whom I had seen in the vision at the first, came to me in swift flight at the time of the evening sacrifice. \[22] He made me understand, speaking with me and saying, “O Daniel, I have now come out to give you insight and understanding. \[23] At the beginning of your pleas for mercy a word went out, and I have come to tell it to you, for you are greatly loved. Therefore consider the word and understand the vision. (ESV)

Then Gabriel tells Daniel about the 70 weeks. The traditional Christian interpretation is that the Messiah of 9:25–26 is Jesus Christ. The 70 weeks culminate with the first Advent of Christ.

![Interpretation 1](https://church.pirn.us/70-weeks-1.png)

A typological interpretation of the 70 weeks is that the vision covers the entire time between the time of Daniel and the second coming of Christ.

Luke 1:11
\[11] And there appeared to \[Zechariah] an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

Luke 11:17–20
\[17] But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household falls. \[18] And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul. \[19] And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. \[20] But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. (ESV)

1 Corinthians 10:18–22
\[18] Consider the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? \[19] What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? \[20] No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. \[21] You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. \[22] Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? (ESV)

Hebrews 12:22–24
\[22] But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, \[23] and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, \[24] and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel. (ESV)

Hebrews 13:2
\[2] Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. (ESV)
