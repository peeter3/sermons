# I SAW SATAN FALL LIKE LIGHTNING FROM HEAVEN

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, I hope you have heard this verse before from Hebrews, chapter 13: **"Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby** ***some have entertained angels unawares*"**  (Heb. 13:2). This verse has caught the attention of many and it has been experienced by many. You may have seen an angel before and not known it. Many people have shared with me that they think they *have* seen an angel—this is nothing unusual. Angels are heavenly creatures that can look like us, so you never know—you might have seen one or even shown hospitality to a heavenly guest.

Angels are heavenly creatures. We behold a host of earthly creatures—we behold turtles and chipmunks—but there is also a host of *heavenly* creatures that we don’t see so easily unless God makes a special provision to show them to su. In Nehemiah, chapter 9, the Levites lead the Jewish people to pray,
> **You are the LORD, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens,**  ***with all their host*, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them; and you preserve all of them; and the host of heaven worships you.**  (Neh. 9:6)


Angels are also a heavenly host under the command of God the Father. Our Lord Jesus Himself says during His Passion,
> **Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?**  (Matt. 26:53)

None of this may be news to you. But here is something about the angels you may not have thought about: the angels can only serve the doctrine of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. For St. Paul tells the churches in Galatia, **“If we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed”** (Gal. 1:8). The doctrine of the Gospel is that *\[Cross]*  Jesus died for sinners.

The Bible also warns us that there are doctrines that go against the Gospel. St. Paul, again, warns us in Romans, chapter 16, **“I appeal to you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles** ***contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught*; avoid them”** (Rom. 16:17). For example, an doctrine contrary to the Gospel is that a man can marry a man and a woman marry a woman. Watch out! There are a bewildering number of obstacles contrary to the Gospel.

Which brings up a question: do all the angels serve these purposes of God? No. Some angels (the devil and the fallen angels) rebelled against God and now seek to destroy everything that is good, especially faith in Christ. [^1] There is mention of these rebellious angels in the book of Jude.
> **I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day.**  (Jude 5–6)

We should be very concerned about Satan and His angels. How can we witness the evil that man commits against his fellow man and deny the existence of Satan and his angels? They are real and they are dangerous … but not a danger at all to those who belong to Jesus.

Belovèd in the Lord, listen to this good news from the mouth of our Lord Jesus, recorded by Luke in today's Holy Gospel:
> **I SAW SATAN FALL LIKE LIGHTNING FROM HEAVEN. Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you. Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.**  (Luke 10:18–20)

Belovèd in the Lord, having confessed our sins to God, let us *\[Cross]*  rejoice in our Savior Jesus who was delivered up for our trespasses and *\[Resurrection]*  raised on the third day for our justification (Rom. 4:25). Who is Jesus? He's the firstborn from the dead (Col. 1:18)—He came out of the grave alive. Alleluia! And who are we who belong to Jesus? The second- and third- and fourth-born from the dead—we are *\[Baptism]*  marked by Baptism to belong to Jesus and are enrolled in the countless host who have conquered death and entered eternal life in heaven. Our names—thanks be to Jesus!—are written in heaven. All Saints is around the corner, and we will go over on November 3 that list of names written in heaven—over that small part of the list that includes those who fell asleep in the Lord during the past church year. Our names, by faith in Jesus, are already on that list, ready to be read some day at an All Saints service.

Our Lord makes this point to us in today's Holy Gospel, and we can do no better that listen to Him: Satan is already defeated for us. Christ defeated the devil for us already with His death and Resurrection. Furthermore, we who belong to Jesus have His authority over any of the angels or demons or schemes of the devil. That is why we will sing on Reformation Sunday, "One little word can fell him," that is, one little word can fell the devil. What is that little word? *The name of Jesus*. Christ defeated the devil for us already with His death and Resurrection. It's exciting to have Christ's name as our own and to have power over the devil, but our Lord tells us not to rejoice over that power so much: rejoice instead that we *are saved* from the devil, from death, and from hell. By the grace of the Spirit may our rejoicing be properly placed and Satan be kept away from us.

Satan's place, our Holy Gospel tells us, is no longer with us and it is no longer in heaven, either. **"I SAW SATAN FALL LIKE LIGHTNING FROM HEAVEN,"**  says the Lord. We see Satan in heaven accusing Job (Job 1–2), but He's no longer there. Our Epistle lesson from Revelation, chapter 12 gives us more detail.
> **Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon. And the dragon and his angels fought back, but he was defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.**  (Rev. 12:7–9)

It is said that a third of the angels were thrown down with Satan (Rev. 12:4).

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep \[our] hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.



## Notes
Nehemiah 9:6
\[6] “You are the LORD, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them; and you preserve all of them; and the host of heaven worships you.

Psalm 34:7
\[7] The angel of the LORD encamps
around those who fear him, and delivers them. (ESV)

Daniel 9:20–23
\[20] While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my plea before the LORD my God for the holy hill of my God, \[21] while I was speaking in prayer, **the man Gabriel**, whom I had seen in the vision at the first, came to me in swift flight at the time of the evening sacrifice. \[22] He made me understand, speaking with me and saying, “O Daniel, I have now come out to give you insight and understanding. \[23] At the beginning of your pleas for mercy a word went out, and I have come to tell it to you, for you are greatly loved. Therefore consider the word and understand the vision. (ESV)

Then Gabriel tells Daniel about the 70 weeks. The traditional Christian interpretation is that the Messiah of 9:25–26 is Jesus Christ. The 70 weeks culminate with the first Advent of Christ.

![Interpretation 1](https://church.pirn.us/70-weeks-1.png)

A typological interpretation of the 70 weeks is that the vision covers the entire time between the time of Daniel and the second coming of Christ.

Luke 1:11
\[11] And there appeared to \[Zechariah] an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

Luke 11:17–20
\[17] But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household falls. \[18] And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul. \[19] And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. \[20] But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. (ESV)

1 Corinthians 10:18–22
\[18] Consider the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? \[19] What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? \[20] No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. \[21] You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. \[22] Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? (ESV)

Hebrews 12:22–24
\[22] But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, \[23] and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, \[24] and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel. (ESV)

Hebrews 13:2
\[2] Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. (ESV)
