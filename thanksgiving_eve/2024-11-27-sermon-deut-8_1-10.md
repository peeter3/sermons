# LEST WE QUICKLY FORGET TO ENDURE IN THANKSGIVING

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, tonight we take the opportunity to be reminded of the basic testimony of Scripture, for our Lord Himself quoted our Old Testament lesson to Satan, **"It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone'"**  (Deut. 8:3; Luke 4:4). Our Lord Jesus was put in the extremely difficult situation of having to endure temptation at the hands of Satan while enduring extreme hunger at the same time, yet He clung to **every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD** without a single word of complaint.

The ones who did complain, the Bible tells us over and over again, were the Israelites in the wilderness. It is one of the basic testimonies of Scripture that Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt, through the wilderness for forty years, and then to the Promised Land. It is noteworthy that while God took perfect care of the Israelites in the wilderness, they complained … often. Did you hear the Old Testament lesson?

**"\[The LORD] humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know."**  There are over a million Israelites sojourning in the wilderness for forty years, where little or no food grows. They do hunger. *\[Ask]*  But does even one of them ever starve? Not one. They are fed six days a week with bread from heaven, and on the sixth day they get a double portion so they can rest on the Sabbath. The LORD, the one true God of Israel, orders everything perfectly so that they are properly fed—a basic testimony of Scripture. And so, we will continue to cover these basic testimonies one after the other LEST *WE* QUICKLY FORGET TO ENDURE IN THANKSGIVING—thanksgiving even for hunger—that it remind us of all the times God does feed us.

**"He fed you with manna that He might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD."**  And here, in the midst of the testimony of Scripture, is that Word of God that is heard from the lips of our Savior Jesus Christ while He Himself has hungered for forty days and in the crosshairs of the devil. And so, we have another basic testimony of Christ, the temptation of our Lord in the wilderness, LEST WE QUICKLY FORGET TO ENDURE IN THANKSGIVING for having God's Word at all—God's *living* Word.


"Your clothing did not wear out on you and your foot did not swell these forty years." This is perhaps a less well-known testimony of Scripture. Hundreds of miles of walking in the wilderness and *not one swollen foot*! The LORD has physically strengthened each and every Israelite for this ordeal, and they're all able to walk it. And how is it possible that clothing does not wear out for forty years? Only by the hand of God LEST WE QUICKLY FORGET TO ENDURE IN THANKSGIVING that God feeds us and clothes us.

*\[Transition]*  And now it is time to hear the testimony of Scripture of the times when the Israelites, for all the perfect care they receive at the hands of the LORD, and in spite of the fact that He has saved them from slavery in Egypt and is faithfully taking them to the land He had promised—in spite of all the blessings that have been showered upon them from the one true God of Israel, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—they grumble—they complain to Moses and to God.

In Deuteronomy, chapter 9, God brings to remembrance the golden calf—the idol of Egypt that, after all of the LORD's faithfulness and steadfast love to the Israelites, they quickly lost their faith and made the golden calf and worshiped it. God would have been righteous to destroy them and blot them out. How quickly they lost their faith when they were tested and forgot to endure in thanksgiving for all the LORD had done and was still doing for them.

We will be tested to forget who our Lord Jesus is and what He's done for us.

We will be tested to forget what has been promised us and all who believe in Jesus. We have a Promised Land: heaven!

> **\[The LORD] humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD.**


**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep \[our] hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

\[1] “Hear, O Israel: you are to cross over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, cities great and fortified up to heaven, \[2] a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard it said, ‘Who can stand before the sons of Anak?’ (ESV)

Numbers 13:33
\[33] And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim), and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.” (ESV)

Deuteronomy 9:4–12
\[4] “Do not say in your heart, after the LORD your God has thrust them out before you, ‘It is because of my righteousness that the LORD has brought me in to possess this land,’ whereas it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is driving them out before you. \[5] Not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart are you going in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God is driving them out from before you, and that he may confirm the word that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\[6] “Know, therefore, that the LORD your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you are a stubborn people. \[7] Remember and do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD. \[8] Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you. \[9] When I went up the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water. \[10] And the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them were all the words that the LORD had spoken with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly. \[11] And at the end of forty days and forty nights the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant. \[12] Then the LORD said to me, ‘Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them; they have made themselves a metal image.’ (ESV)

Deuteronomy 9:22
\[22] “At Taberah also, and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked the LORD to wrath. (ESV)

Numbers 11:1–3
\[1] And the people complained in the hearing of the LORD about their misfortunes, and when the LORD heard it, his anger was kindled, and the fire of the LORD burned among them and consumed some outlying parts of the camp. \[2] Then the people cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to the LORD, and the fire died down. \[3] So the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the LORD burned among them. (ESV)

Exodus 17:1–7
\[1] All the congregation of the people of Israel moved on from the wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. \[2] Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?” \[3] But the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?” \[4] So Moses cried to the LORD, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.” \[5] And the LORD said to Moses, “Pass on before the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel, and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. \[6] Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people will drink.” And Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. \[7] And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the LORD by saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?” (ESV)

Numbers 11:31–34
\[31] Then a wind from the LORD sprang up, and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the ground. \[32] And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail. Those who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp. \[33] While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck down the people with a very great plague. \[34] Therefore the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had the craving. (ESV)

Deuteronomy 9:27–29
\[27] Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not regard the stubbornness of this people, or their wickedness or their sin, \[28] lest the land from which you brought us say, “Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.” \[29] For they are your people and your heritage, whom you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.’ (ESV)

1 Timothy 2:8
\[8] I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling; (ESV)
