# I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB.

Let us pray. *\[Prayer]*  Amen.

Belovèd in the Lord, if you were able to participate in the Bible study when we studied the Nicene Creed, some of this may be familiar. I will zero in on one particular verse from today's Holy Gospel, and that is John 8:58: **"Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM,' "**  This verse must be carefully read and properly interpreted or else we're in a world of trouble.

From this verse we can branch out into the rest of Scripture, but before we do, let's review basic grammar. Verbs have *tense*. *\[Ask]*  Who remembers what tense is?
* There's present perfect tense.
* There's present perfect continuous tense.
* There past perfect continuous tense, and more!

But let's keep it simple: we'll stick with simple past tense and simple present tense. *\[Illustration]*  Allow me to give you an example. Now that the weather's warm, we're both standing on the dock, ready to jump in the water, and I say, "Before you jump, I jump." That's simple present tense: the action is happening now. Okay—splash!—before you go in, I go in. Now we're both treading water and I look back at the dock and say, "Before you jumped, I *jumped*." That's simple past tense: the action happened in the past. Now, what would you think if we're treading water and I said, "Before you jumped, I *jump*." That would sound strange because the sentence doesn't make sense because the tenses should match—"you jumped and I *jumped*"—but I just said, "You jumped and I *jump*." My sentence does not make sense. In John 8:58, it appears at first glance that our Lord does not make sense because He says, **"Before Abraham was, I AM."**  What would make sense would be if He said, "Before Abraham was, I was." What are we to do—fix our Lord's grammar? When we translate the Bible, should we help our readers by having Christ say, "Before Abraham was, I was"? If we did—even with the best of intentions—we would be doing our readers a huge disservice.

*\[Transition]*  For we need to remember the account of Moses and the burning bush from Exodus, chapter 3. We are at a huge disadvantage if we read John, chapter 8 without first knowing Exodus, chapter 3. *\[Ask]*  Who remembers Moses and the burning bush?

John 5:18
\[18] This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. (ESV)

**The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.
