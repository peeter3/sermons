# COUNT ON CHRIST'S WORD

Belovèd in the Lord—and I am particularly honored to be addressing this gathering—our Lord Jesus bless you and keep you clean as you abide in Him—and as you produce, by the grace of the Spirit, that fruit that proves you to be His disciples.

The theme for our retreat is *Abide in Me*, which quotes our Lord from today's Holy Gospel. When I hear *Abide in Me* I cannot help but recall *Abide with me*, which we just sang *\[Sing]*  :
> *Abide with me, fast falls the eventide.* 
> *The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide.* 
> *When other helpers fail and comforts flee,* 
> *Help of the helpless, O abide with me.*

This hymn is so well-known that many of us know this first stanza by heart. *When other helpers fail*—you, who have taken your time to attend a Christian women's retreat may be retreating here because you are quite aware of these other helpers that fail. Our evangelist also wrote an epistle, from which we hear in 1 John, chapter 2,
> **Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.**  (1 John 2:15–17)

Furthermore, our Lord Himself declares in Matthew, chapter 24, **"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My Words will not pass away"**  (Matt. 24:35)—Christ's Word never fails and we are even given the Holy Spirit to keep us reminded of Christ's holy Word (John 14:26). By the grace of the Spirit, we turn our attention away from the world and onto Christ's Word at all times. In order to do God's will—for our actions to testify of the One in whom we believe—for our hearts to be sanctified so that we speak words that rebuke sin yet are quick to forgive in Jesus' name—in order to stay grafted into Christ and bear the fruit our Father is looking for—we have *nothing* but Christ's Word to count on—not money, not health, not even family—nothing to count on but Christ's Word.

*\[Transtition]*  And so, let us cling to Christ's Word and abide with Him. For our foundation we turn to St. Paul, who declares, **"The Word** ***of the Cross*** **is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God"**  (1 Cor. 1:18). With us and in us, belovèd sisters, abides our Lord Jesus, who is God born of Mary, who bore our sins on that awe-ful day, when, as the Lord declared through the mouth of Zechariah, He removed the iniquity of the land in a single day (Zech. 3:9). And so, as my sister Merri will be going over with you different ways to abide in Jesus, I will lay here the foundation—the foundation where Jesus as the cornerstone so that we are built into that house of living stones (1 Peter 2:5). We have nothing greater to confess than that Jesus, begotten of the Father and born of the virgin Mary, is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29)—He takes away our sin and He takes away the sin of everyone we deal with every day.

We will soon be singing the *Agnus Dei* in the Service of the Sacrament. Belovèd sisters, learn it well, and I suggest that you keep it on your lips throughout the week to help you to confess Christ in your hearts at all times. (Let's turn to it and sing it now.) *\[Sing]*
> *O Christ, Thou Lamb of God, that takest away the sin of the world, have mercy upon us.*
> *O Christ, Thou Lamb of God, that takest away the sin of the world, have mercy upon us.*
> *O Christ, Thou Lamb of God, that takest away the sin of the world, grant us Thy peace. Amen.*

Learning the *Agnus Dei* by heart—you may already know it well—having it ready to sing at all times will come in handy for abiding in Jesus—staying grafted into the living vine, for the last thing we want is to be broken off. You may be more familiar with another version of the *Agnus Dei*—that's fine—use that one.

And then, belovèd sisters, never forget *where* the Agnus Dei is sung: *\[altar]*  it's sung in the Service of the Sacrament. Talk about ***abide IN Me***: **"Take, eat; this is My body. … Drink of it, all of you; this cup is the New Testament in My blood, which is shed for you for the forgiveness of sins."**  From the Cross … to our lips … to abide *inside* of us come our Lord Jesus Christ. By His own Word, we cannot deny—no matter how the devil and the world rage—we cannot deny that He truly abides *in* us.

And so, belovèd sisters, we have been given the *Agnus Dei* and the Sacrament as a foundation for abiding in Jesus. Let us bear fruit patiently, and know that even as we are being pruned, *\[altar]*  we cannot deny that He abides in us. **The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus** (Phil. 4:7). Amen.

## Notes
Matthew 13:22–23
\[22] As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. \[23] As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.” (ESV)

John 15:3
\[3] Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. (ESV)

And it is true: we are helpless without our Lord Jesus and we do well to invite Him to be with us at all times. We might be helpless because we're ill. We might be helpless because we're in a situation where we've tried everything and nothing seems to get better—again, it could be our illness that hasn't gotten better—it may be, for example, a loved one's illness that hasn't gotten better and has great impact on those around us. We need the Lord's help—we need Him to be with us to get through the situation.

But the situation in our hearts may be the worst of all. Born with sin is a bad place to start, and God knows what we've added to it. *\[Font]*  Even after we are baptized in the Name of the One True God, we know—and St. Paul is careful to point out—
> *I need Thy presence ev're passing hour;* 
> *What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r?*

Beware of the Law's effect on the flesh: it only makes us want to sin more (Rom. 7:9).

COUNT ON CHRIST'S WORD for yourself.

COUNT ON CHRIST'S WORD for others.
